<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="p1 pn center mid">A COLD SLOT.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The upper end of the mercury is anchored, say
in the vicinity of twenty degrees below zero, and
there are two feet of snow on the ground. I have
to travel a hundred miles or more from Denver;
one mile on foot, the others by rail.</p>

<p>As I make my way down street early in the
morning, with the rising sun turning the white
peaks into rose-color, I feel disposed to halt and
watch the changes. But I am denied the privilege
of even walking slowly; I must wipe the tears
from my eyes and hurry. The few people I meet
seem cheery, and they steam along, reminding me
of the cigarette smokers; the men wear icicles for
beards, and one woman has a luminous nose, and
I think is aware of it, for she holds her handkerchief
to her face as she passes by. No one says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
good-morning&mdash;we have become too metropolitan
for such courtesies&mdash;but every one expresses by a
glance, "Cold! ain't it?" and steams on. One
should always keep one's mouth shut on such a
morning; one's inspirations will always be full
and the shoulders thrown back without trying&mdash;that
is if one be healthy. There is not the faintest
indication of a breeze, and the iron tires of a
heavy freight wagon, laboring slowly along, ring
out like the music of tiny bells, close and smooth,
as though the master of the baton were directing
a legato movement. The driver walks by the side
of his team, thrashing one hand against his
shoulder and holding the lines with the other; the
horses are half hidden in the steam of their own
providing and are frosted even to their flanks.
Thunder and Mars! but it is cold! and a cloud of
cold air rushes into the car with me. The ebony
deity presiding over the coach looked on with a
wide, white smile as I thawed my beard.</p>

<p>"Ain't gwine fishin' to-day?"</p>

<p>He seemed a little puzzled when I said I might
indulge in a bit of angling. Perhaps he had never
fished through the ice, or was not aware that the
art of angling depended upon other things than
bait and hook and line, or was not aware, in fact,
that these tools might be dispensed with, and the
votary of the gentle art still be successful.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Pike's Peak from Manitou Park.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">The only other occupants of the car were two
young ladies, neither of them over twenty years of
age, I dare be sworn, and behind whom the porter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
assigned me a seat. They sat facing each other.
One of these young ladies was a blonde with fluffy
hair daintily banged, her cheeks were rosy and
she reveled in the faintest intimation of brevity
of nose&mdash;just enough of heavenward proclivity to
make it cunning. Her companion was a brunette
in glasses, possessing a delicate creamy complexion
and a close-fitting dainty ear, not marred by a
ring or a place for one. I speak of one ear, the
one immediately under my observation. I subsequently
learned that she was endowed with a pair,
and they were mates, very pretty, and uninfluenced
by the cold, of a delicate pink that seemed to rival
the exquisite tint of sea shells I had seen; a very
bewitching ear, an ear into which a lover&mdash;but
perhaps I would better not follow the lead of that
ear any farther, and will let go before I fall into
trouble. Being absorbed I did not catch what the
blonde said to the ear, but having released myself,
I took in the reply:</p>

<p>"Darwin's theory is, to my mind, correct, and
the strongest argument in favor of immortality
within my experience."</p>

<p>An experience of less than twenty years! Think
of it!</p>

<p>The blonde put on a look of deeper interest; as
for myself, a feeling of weak dependence began to
creep over me and finally settled in my back. The
brunette continued:</p>

<p>"We know that man is an improvement on the
monkey, and we know how imperfect man is even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
in his best estate&mdash;are we not authorized in believing
that the next change will present something
grander?"</p>

<p>I began to wonder whether some man had not
failed in his contract with this young lady. The
glasses suggested Boston, and yet she was too
young for a vagrant schoolma'am or a victim in a
desert world. I debated concerning the man and
whether I should blame him, if one were in the
case, and my wonder quite resolved itself into a
conviction in favor of the man. To set my mind
at rest if possible, I changed my seat to one behind
the blonde. When I saw the pretty, quiet face,
and the eloquent, brown eyes appealing to the
blonde for approval, I was more in doubt than
ever. To get out of the labyrinth I went into the
smoking room and took counsel of my briar-root
and the foot-hills.</p>

<p>Snow everywhere! The willows are dressed in
gray and the pines are almost black; the purple
haze of summer has changed into a veil of white
and the shrub oaks are garmented in ragged coats
of brown. No living thing, except the snow-birds,
is in sight between me and the hills, piling tier
upon tier to the summit of the range. It is not
like looking back from the front seat in the pit
upon a grand-opera night&mdash;the colors are all sober.
Where the rugged cliffs are too precipitous for the
snow to cling, I find Titanic jewels with white
settings. It is a good time to learn, in truth, how
rough and broken are the outlines that the summer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
breath makes smooth. Stripped of their
finery their majesty is sterner, that is all, but they
are still to be reverenced&mdash;there is the difference,
merely, between the smile and the frown of one
we know to be worthy of love, but always lovable.
The fences make the white fields look like great,
clean napkins edged with black lace and spread
out smoothly, to dry.</p>

<p>As we get farther away from the Platte Valley a
bird of evil omen shows himself, looking blacker,
if possible, as he hovers over this ocean of white.
I wonder what has become of the ravens? In the
early days they were plentiful and tame, coming
into town and perching on the fences and housetops,
alert for food, and in the evening, before
twilight would set in they were wont to string
along overhead, upon lazy wing, to their roost up
the river. We must have become too metropolitan
also for these sable friends and they are going out
with the pioneers! When I saw this solitary
representative of the old abundance, he brought
to me the remembrance of other changes&mdash;I realized
thirty miles an hour and steam, instead of
ten miles and mules; a luxurious car with scarcely
a vibration, instead of the swaying Concord redolent
of old leather, musty hay and the stables.
Overcoats, buffalo shoes and blankets are necessaries
no longer. Yet the old coach possessed
some excellent attributes: it was a great leveller
of artificial barriers; its patrons were democratic
in its presence if never so before or after; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
were rarely otherwise than jolly; the emergency
demanded cheerfulness, as hardship always does if
one would succeed in overcoming obstacles; one
might not sit and dream with open eyes in such
surroundings. Shadows of familiar faces are flitting
about me, very eloquent they are in their
silence. And now and then will come one, and
another, demanding deeper recognition and whose
ways are so sweet to remember that I forget all
except the old coaching days and&mdash;</p>

<p>But I declare! while I have been drifting, the
window has grown dim&mdash;it must be with the frost&mdash;and
I am compelled to wipe it off that I may
see a bevy of snow-buntings; bright little fellows
in mottled jackets and black neckties. They easily
make, in their billowy flight, twenty-five miles an
hour. The train is going at that rate, or more,
and they keep along with it as if to cheer us on
the road for a few hundred yards and then alight
to have their places taken by others. They are
very numerous, thanks to some one who loved
them and placed a penalty in the statute books
against their destruction.</p>

<p>Down there in a hollow, sheltered by the bluffs,
are a cabin and a corral, and a few stacks of hay
protected by a fence. Outside stand three creatures
drawn up, and shivering, it must be, wishfully
feeding their minds on the unattainable luxury
under their noses. I would like to halt long
enough to drive the owner out of bed, or away
from his fire, with hydraulic appliances. A magpie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
alights on the back of one of the cows, perhaps
to inspire her with hope and to remind her that
summer will come again.</p>

<p>As we climb toward the summit of the Divide I
catch a glimpse of one of my castles. When
travelling by I always look out for this property of
mine, to assure myself that it has not been trespassed
upon. Some one has taken the liberty of
levelling a camera at it, and bestowing a name
upon it, thinking it deserted, perhaps, and assuming
a claim upon it for that reason. But it is not,
nor has it ever been deserted since my knowledge
of it; my people are always there. Sweeping
round a certain curve in the road the grand pile,
without moat or drawbridge, now comes into full
view. Its white turrets shine in the morning sun
and its grand doorway is always open as a token
of the hospitality ever to be found in its spacious
halls. It is the old-time hospitality, of course&mdash;say
of the feudal age&mdash;rude, maybe, but bestowed with
royal munificence, to be in keeping with the precincts.
Claw-hammer coats, vests of percale cut
low, and glaring shirt fronts of linen would be
novelties amid the concourse of mailed cavaliers
and hardy retainers wont to gather here. Its
great banqueting hall is decked with ghosts of
armor and the rugged walls are hung with rude
implements in keeping with the ghosts; the skins
of beasts serve as beds or floor cloths as occasion
may demand; rough benches and a long table with
no sign of covering; a high stiff-backed chair at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the end above the salt, where may sit the master.
The broad fireplace is aglow this cold day and the
fire roars and sparkles up the wide chimney, and
dogs lie dozing in its cheerful warmth, while
leather-clothed servitors clank back and forth.
But how quickly the dogs awake and all the surroundings
vanish at the sound of the shriek ahead
of me! We have seen much at the rate we are
going&mdash;and it is better so&mdash;we are not moving
backward; the broadcloth claw-hammer is, after
all, an improvement on the coat of mail.</p>

<p>My other grand estate south of the Divide is
also encumbered with the winter mantle, and because
of it the red ruins over under the foot-hills
are more sharply defined. The red castle on the
left with its arched porchway stands out grandly
against the clear blue background. But there is
no one at home, the place seems deserted for the
time; the usual inmates may be away on a hunt in
those groves beyond, or perhaps they may have
vanished for the same reason as did those we found
on the north side.</p>

<p>The air grows warmer as we go on. Above the
Peak a few clouds are hovering, and I notice above
the summits of the lower mountains two long,
slender clouds of a deadwood color. Presently
these join at one end, and soon the other ends
swing together and form an oval with a stretch of
blue between, and there is a lake above the horizon.
It requires no stretch of the imagination;
on the contrary, I find I am compelled to satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
my mind that one part of the cloud must be above
the other, else the highest is the near shore, in the
plane of my vision, and I look across a sheet of
blue water to the farther side. An irregular rift
in one place makes a cove, and on the bank is a
cabin, and around the edges is fallen timber.
Thanks to the absent winds, I am for twenty minutes
or more treated to this view of a lake and its
wooded surroundings, made of a strip of blue sky
and a cloud.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that I disclose where I had
dinner this day&mdash;there were no bills of fare printed,
and as I took a seat at one of the small tables I
saw that the others were not crowded. It was
evidently a cold day for the landlord as well as the
rest of us. At one of the tables stood the blonde,
her hat and cloak off, and a dainty white apron,
with frills and pockets, tied about her waist. She
was evidently not here in the character of a guest.
Before I had time to wonder why she might be
here in the other capacity, a voice at my shoulder
said rapidly:</p>

<p>"Roast-beef-boiled-mutton-caper-sauce-pork-and-beans-veal-pie."</p>

<p>I  thought I recognized the tones and squared
myself to take in the glasses and brown eyes of
the brunette. While I studied them she said it
all over again in the same key and without pause,
as though under conviction that she would forget
a part if she failed in the stereotyped manner.
She smiled at the end of the second stanza and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
saw that her teeth were very white and even&mdash;were
pretty, indeed, and so was the smile. She sang it
again, a note higher, and at the conclusion I could
trace only the ghost of the smile. It was time
for me to respond. I was painfully aware of it, but
somehow I persisted in wandering away thousands
of ages and drifting about in the mysteries of the
primary period, barking my shins on the azoic
rocks trying to find the starting-point and to trace
the connection.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what you want?"</p>

<p>The mood was now imperative. I said I could
not tell her that, but I would take pork and beans.<br /><br /></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="p1 pn center mid">A WARMER TRAIL.</p>

<p class="pn p2">A scientific knowledge of botany is by no
means essential to happiness. Latin does not add
an atom of beauty to the wild clematis. One can
admire a healthy, bright-eyed baby without knowing
its name. This morning after I start out on
the railroad I notice that the July flowers are
abundant on the slopes leading up to the foot-hills.
Great patches of wild poppies grow here and there&mdash;it
is not an infatuating plant, but one loses sight
of the coarse leaves in the delicate white of the
bloom. The bluish-gray of the wild chamomile of
itself makes a rich carpet, but into this the hand
of the Master has woven a countless variety of
colors. Hanging in bountiful clusters of crimson
and scarlet is a little flower, shaped like that of
the honeysuckle; beside it, pendant from their
slender stems, a wealth of purple bells, while a
little canary-colored gem&mdash;a tiny, perfect, five-pointed
star&mdash;peeps up modestly, as if asking permission
to add its atom to the gorgeous pattern.
So we have acres of tender beauty. I am glad to
know that I am not alone in the enjoyment of it.
At the first station, where the liberty of a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
minutes' pause is allowed, a gentleman with his
trousers in his boots gives us to understand that
appearances are deceitful, by gathering a bouquet,
and a young man in light-colored tweed, small
umbrella and eyeglass redeems himself also, in like
manner. The ladies are delighted and full of wonder,
so beautiful they are&mdash;the flowers, I mean, yet
lacking fragrance; how can it be? Two senses at
least expectant and only one can be gratified? A
little three-year-old, disappointed, stigmatizes them
as "weed flowers," but is compelled, at the instance
of a juvenile friend, to admit: "They are pretty,
anyway." They have a generous influence too;
people who had barely looked at each other for
forty miles, pleasantly express a common sentiment
one to another, it may be a smile or a glance
merely, but it is sufficient to make them know
they are of kin; even the young man with the
umbrella unbends and feels on the same plane
with humanity.</p>

<p>The delicate haze of summer is again upon the
hills; the great, white napkins of a little while ago
are changed into fields of grain shimmering in the
sun as they are brushed by the gentle wind; the
cattle no longer haunt the hay-stack, but slowly
feed along the mesas, or, filled and sleek, complacently
chew their cuds in the shadows of the pines;
my castles on the Divide give evidence of thrift in
the surroundings, and in their summer garb display
the exquisite taste of their mistress; the song
of the meadow lark strikes high above the roar of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the car wheels, and you lose entirely the clang of
the iron in the clear, sweet trill from the golden-throated
beauty perched upon an adjacent fence,
or half hid in some grassy tussock; the pines have
turned to a lighter green, the willows are in full
leaf, and as the eye sweeps over the brilliant carpet
toward the foot-hills and beyond, it encounters the
only sign of winter in the patches of snow lingering
in the clefts of the distant range; you mark
the irregular sky-line of the towering summits
against that background of delicate blue, while
the loftier peaks may be kissed by a cloud. Does
disease weigh you down; do you fret under the
vexations and disappointments of the daily drudgery;
has the sordid strife among your fellows
made you feel that life is not worth living; does
sorrow brood in your heart? Why, look you, this
leaf is a panacea for hurt minds! it was not created
for you, but you are so constituted that you may
find solace in it if you will&mdash;it is one of the many
out of the book that gives our copper-hued, untutored
brother, <i>faith</i>. Will you accept less than he?</p>

<p>But I am reminded that if I loiter so, I shall
not reach Cascade in a week. The Deacon, a young
friend of mine, and the Major, are to join me
there, fully equipped for a campaign in the Roan
Range. I propose, however, to make them stop
by the way, as the humor moves me.</p>

<p>Speeding across and down the south side of the
Divide, I notice trespassers on a part of my whilom
wild estate under the foot-hills at the right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Specks of cottages perched upon the slope of one
of my glades do not add to the romance of the
picture, yet I feel a bit flattered in that the builders
have exhibited good taste in selecting a location
for their brown-roofed boxes. They can be cool
in summer and enjoy a view of mountains and
plains. Then they may speculate, too, upon what
preceded the pines and grass-covered earth about
them. The gorge just back of them, and the
meagre creek tumbling out from it, give a hint,
and as we move quickly down the narrow valley
dolmens here and there indicate that the little
creek is only the remains of a river of ice. These
monuments of the centuries are very abundant
hereabouts. I have seen fossilized bivalves from
this same drift down which I am speeding, and
am set to wondering what kind of mortals inhabited
these shores when those oysters were growing,
and whether the brown-roofed cottages on the
slope above are an improvement upon the architecture
of that epoch. Or how many millions of
years preceding that ice and ocean age this same
valley was a bed of verdure, as now; and whether
those who stirred up the soil are permitted to look
on us and whether they do so in sympathy with
us in our tragedies, or are our tragedies all comedies
to them?</p>

<p>Loitering again! well, why may one not loiter
when he finds a thrifty city of his own time flourishing
on an old ocean bed? This new city is filled
with the refinement and culture of the age, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
its outlying shanties have an air of respectability.
It has its share of vices too, no doubt; however,
reformation is not my mission, the duties are too
delicate; I might be admonished to "throw the
first stone" if I dared. But there is no harm in
wondering whether the culture and refinement
that flourished in the same spot a great many centuries
ago was different from the present ideal.
We will not discuss it, as you suggest, but sweep
round and into the mountain gorge at our right,
looking down, as we speed along, upon Manitou.
The Spirit invites one to linger again, and there
is comfort in the reflection that the Kind Mother
will welcome our coming, without stopping to inquire
whether we are compelled by the result of
our vices to seek her beautiful places, or are
prompted by our virtues.</p>

<p>Thirty years since, the way we are travelling was
an unbroken wilderness; the Ute was only then
being succeeded by the prospector. Had it been
suggested to the latter that his successors would
ever journey by rail, it would have moved him to
pity for the unfortunate mental plight of the
prophet. A broad-gauge train of cars speeding
over the way where he found it toilsome to creep!
Could anything be more preposterous? Yet we
are careening round graceful curves upon the precipitous
mountain sides, rushing over bridges that
span yawning chasms, plunging from light into
darkness and out again from the short tunnels
into the light, ever on and up without impediment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Surely, for the first time, it is like a pleasant
dream, and one almost forgets to take in the
gorgeous, ever-changing panorama made up of
pinnacles, pine-clad hills, towering cliffs and flashing
stream. Soon the gorge widens into a cozy
dell; to the right, a gentle grass-covered slope,
with countless wild flowers woven into the pattern,
and groups of young pines here and there,
leads up to a tier of hills with rock-crowned summits.
To the left is Cascade Cañon, sentineled by
lofty cliffs, and from out its shady recesses comes
tumbling the bright mountain stream that suggested
the name.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="p1">The departing train leaves, besides myself, the
gentleman with the eyeglasses and slim umbrella.
After dinner, while I solace myself with the briar-root,
this gentleman sits a little way off on the
veranda puffing a cigar. There is another, an
obese party, walking up and down; he is not to be
mistaken; his boots are shiny, so are his coat and
trousers, and his felt hat gives token of grease
and dust about the band. His shirt bosom discloses
a compromise between cheviot and wool,
and he wears an immense gold nugget for a breast-pin.
He possesses the air of one with prospects
and bestows an occasional glance of inquiry upon
the gentleman with the umbrella. He catches the
latter's eye, and halts, almost imperceptibly, feels
encouraged, nods and approaches; then with an
expression of boundless hospitality pervading his
entire person, bursts forth:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"A stranger in Colorado?"</p>

<p>The gentleman with the eyeglasses pauses in the
middle of a puff, looks up staringly, and the next
moment relapses into his wonted contentment,
while the native takes a seat.</p>

<p>"Ya-a-s."</p>

<p>"The grandest country in the world; scenery
unsurpassed, and the climate superb; the air&mdash;there's
nothing like the vivifying air&mdash;do you notice
the air?"</p>

<p>"Notice&mdash;ah&mdash;notice the aha?"</p>

<p>The stranger dropped his eyeglass, replaced it
suddenly and stared a further inquiry at his interrogator.</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;the lightness of it&mdash;its purity&mdash;the
ozone, as it were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;y-a-s&mdash;I smell the fwagwance of the pines,
and I feel sleepy when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've struck it, my dear sir&mdash;that's what
every one says&mdash;they always feel sleepy on first
coming out&mdash;but you'll overcome that in time&mdash;it's
a wide-awake country, you will find."</p>

<p>"You have wesided some time in Colowado,
y-a-s?"</p>

<p>"Well, y-e-s, so, so&mdash;a few years, long enough to
become acquainted with the ways of the country.
I came out to see about certain little mining interests,"
he continued in a burst of confidence,
"and was detained longer than I expected, and
now, I could not be induced to go anywhere else
to live."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an air of firmness in this avowal of
attachment that carried conviction with it.</p>

<p>"You are intawested in mines&mdash;y-a-s?"</p>

<p>"Slightly&mdash;enough to occupy my leisure time,
that is all."</p>

<p>From the manner of the man he might have
owned the State, exclusive of the mines.</p>

<p>"I have one nice little piece of property over in
Dead Man's Gulch, I think of developing some day."</p>

<p>And while he patted this property on the back,
so to speak, he plunged his hand into his pocket
for&mdash;a specimen, of course&mdash;"ruby silver"&mdash;fabulous
in ounces to the ton.</p>

<p>"Wooby silvah?" I heard the stranger inquire,
as I relighted my pipe and started for the cañon.</p>

<p>The broad avenue quickly narrows into a trail,
leading into charming nooks and shady retreats.
The air is fragrant with the perfume of the pines
and the half mile of cascades contributes to the
delight with its music. The bed of this mountain
brook is precipitous and has no still reaches in its
current. There are seemingly a dozen picturesque
waterfalls in its course, and the giver of names
seems for once to have been moved with happy intelligence
and good taste. At the Naiads' Bath I
come to a halt in search of an Old Man, who, I am
told, presides over this place sacred to the spirits
that flit hereabout, to indulge in their holy ablutions.
The early afternoon sun lights up the gray
and brown of the cliffs almost overhead and helps
work the stately rocks into fantastic shapes. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
find him at last, on the opposite mountain side, a
tutelary deity carved out of the cold rock by the
hand of old Time, and looking down silent and
grim upon the consecrated pool of crystal. Not a
great way below his chin, sits a modern belle, thin
at the waist and with flowing skirts. The sculptor
must have anticipated the day when she would
be in the fashion, and set her up as a satire in the
sanctuary.</p>

<p>While I rest here, peering into the depths in
search of the ethereal beauties which I know
must be sporting there, and who will be revealed
to me by the bright rays glinting through the
foliage, and while I listen in vain to catch some
change in the deep notes of the silvery organ
almost at my side, I am conscious of another presence
and look up. The young woman in glasses
and her companion with the fluffy hair are standing
within a few feet of me. I am at once reduced
to plain diet; even Darwin is forgotten, as his fair
disciple with uplifted hands exclaims:</p>

<p>"Is it not lovely!"</p>

<p>Her companion had barely time ecstatically to
coincide, when the man with the mine and his
newly-found acquaintance climbed into sight. The
man with the mine remarked for the benefit of all:</p>

<p>"Splendid site for an overshot wheel."</p>

<p>The gentleman with the umbrella said:</p>

<p>"Chawming," leaving one in doubt.</p>

<p>But a startled and evident feeling of astonishment
made itself manifest in this gentleman's face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
as the Darwinian, hearing voices behind her,
turned in his direction.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Gwace," he exclaimed, dropping
his umbrella and extending both hands, "this is a
vewey gwatifying supwise."</p>

<p>Miss Grace did not seem so much gratified, accepting
one hand only, and allowing "Mr. Dide,"
as she named him, to recover his umbrella with
the other.</p>

<p>I considered it high time for me to move on. I
had not gone far when I heard a footstep behind
me, and looking back, discovered the native puffing
up the trail. He had taken off his coat, and
was perspiring freely, so I halted, feeling a weakness
for the practical mind. At the same time I
took comfort in the reflection that there were
many economical methods of exit from this life,
and that the man with the mine might find one
to his taste. If he would only fall off a rock!
When he came up very red in the face and had
mopped his thinly-covered temples with a questionable
handkerchief, he told me it was "hot."
I acquiesced by a nod, and he felt encouraged. I
knew intuitively what he would say next, and in
that affirmative sort of way that precludes denial:</p>

<p>"Stranger in Colorado? What part of the east
are you from?"</p>

<p>"Italy."</p>

<p>"No! why, you talk like a native."</p>

<p>As it was the only word he heard me utter I considered
him a competent judge, and felt flattered.<br /><br /></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">I inquired if he had explored the cañon, and he
reluctantly denied that he had, but was going now
to the top, notwithstanding it was "hot work"
for a man of his "build." I wanted to give him
credit, and would have done so, but for his remark
touching the beautiful waterfall below. While I
kept moving it was impossible for him to talk
without discomfort, and I prayed that the way
might become more precipitous. Suddenly the
trail presented a termination. The rocks towered
up grandly to the right, to the left was a steep
incline, and directly in front a pile of rocks blocking
up the way, save for a slight rift that might
admit my working through. "The prayer of the
wicked availeth not." I felt that I was one of the
righteous: the man with the mine could never accomplish
that keyhole, nor could he get around it.
I went on with reverence and humility. When I
looked around he stood on the lower side of the
impassable barrier in evident contemplation, his
hat pushed back, his coat still on his arm, and one
hand poised in the act of mopping his dripping
face. I found the grotto: great slabs of granite
leaning together at the top and edges made smooth
by the tempests of the ages, leaving a capacious,
cool retreat below. I felt a momentary regret at
the condition of the man with the mine, and lay
in the shade listening to the music of the brook
singing to me its mysteries: whence it came,
whither it was going, and of its adventures thus
far by the way.</p>

<p class="p1 pn center mid">TWIN LAKES.</p>


<p class="pn p2">When the Deacon put in his appearance the
next day according to appointment, he desired to
know, first, whether I had gone up the cañon. I
told him I had, then he wanted to know what I
had seen to be pleased with. I advised him that
when I had a week's leisure, and he felt inclined to
listen, I would "dilate fully" my afternoon's experience;
that a week devoted to the relation of
each half day's enjoyment would be none too
much; whereat he seemed tickled, for the cañon
is a weakness with him. When I told him I had
returned from the grotto in the cool of the afternoon
after a delightful interview with the nymphs
of the neighborhood, he insisted that I had made
a mistake; that I should have climbed on up to
the carriage road, and returned by that way,
whence a delightful view of the valley and the
wooded mountain sides could be obtained. But I
reminded him I was in the humor to court the
hidden recesses rather than the sunlight, and besides,
that just above the grotto it was necessary,
if I would go on, to swing-off a perpendicular rock
six feet, and I did not care to risk the leap. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
he advised me of another trail turning off to the
road, just below the Naiads' Bath, where the
ascent was easy, and exacted a promise that the
next time I would come out that way.</p>

<p>The Deacon being assigned to the office of guide
and general counsellor concerning the early part of
this expedition, he suggested that we take a trip
into Manitou Park. It became my duty to inform
him that we could not in a season, let alone three
weeks, visit all the places of interest this side of
White River; that we might stop a day or two at
Twin Lakes and thence we must go straight into
the wilderness.</p>

<p>"But there is a party going over into the park
this afternoon; the station is only eight miles up
the road, and we can have a delightful drive of
half a dozen miles, and be back in time for the
west-bound train to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Whom shall we have in this party, Deacon?"</p>

<p>"A couple of ladies, and a man&mdash;a dude&mdash;with
an eyeglass; the ladies are pretty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Deacon! Deacon! none o' that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But see here, I mean the ladies are attractive,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand&mdash;one talks Darwin and wears
glasses, and the other is a blonde."</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;where did you become acquainted
with them? I had thought to introduce you."</p>

<p>I was compelled to set the Deacon right and inform
him of my last winter's trip. Then I declined
his offer of an introduction. He seemed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
little nettled at my indifference, and thereupon I
pleaded old age in extenuation of my lack of gallantry.</p>

<p>"But, Deacon, how long have you been acquainted
with these ladies; and who are they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, several months&mdash;the train is coming, let
us go in to dinner."</p>

<p>I conjectured that there was a sensitive spot in
the Deacon's anatomy, and I had unconsciously
touched it with a rude hand. To apologize further
at present might provoke embarrassment, and yet
I feared something more was demanded of me.
He came to my relief by taking a seat at the same
table with the parties in question, leaving me in
company with the Major, who had arrived on the
train.</p>

<p>"Where is the Deacon?" was the Major's first
inquiry. I motioned in the direction.</p>

<p>"Whom have we there?" I could give him no
information, of course, and we discussed our dinner
with the prospects which Twin Lakes might
afford.</p>

<p>From the rear end of the train as it nears Manitou
Park station, a view is had of the great peak
which dwarfs that from the plains. The mountain
seems to quadruple in size and grows in grandeur,
until the great mass overtopping its companions
appears to be standing alone, endowed
with the consciousness of its own majesty. Miles
beyond, and when we are traversing the lower end
of the great South Park, the noble pile still stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
out, from its azure background, the gray of its
rocks and the snow-drifts flashing down a royal
smile in the afternoon light. Ahead of us is the
Musquito Range, with Buffalo Peak serving as another
grand landmark in the bewildering assemblage
of lofty mountains; and the park, for thirty
miles, seemingly as level as a floor, reposes peacefully
in its cordon of hills.<br /><br /></p>

</div></div>

<p class="p1">At Idlewild our list of travellers is added to&mdash;a
broad-shouldered young man and a young woman.
The boot heels of the young man appear uncomfortably
high, and he consequently bears his weight
upon his turned-in toes. The new doeskin trousers
incase a pair of caliper legs, carrying with them
the impression that their owner is astride an invisible
something and is not at all accustomed to
walking; the Prince Albert is unbuttoned and the
white vest is ornamented by a large chain with
a silver horse pendant; a low-crowned, broad-brimmed,
white felt hat with a wide leather band,
is thrown back from a face that is sunburned but
smiling; the eyes of the young man are, no doubt,
keen even in repose, but there is a shade of embarrassment
lingering about them; he evidently
feels that everybody in the car understands the
situation, and he is ready to be friendly or defiant
as occasion may demand. The color in the young
woman's cheeks deepens as she smilingly bustles
into the only unoccupied seat, and when the couple
have settled down there is plenty of room on the
end of the seat for another. She has a paper bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of cookies; she takes a bite from one and reaches
it up to him, he absorbs the remainder as complacently
as a two-year-old being fed with a spoon.
The cookies disappear rapidly after this fashion;
meantime a sleeve of the Prince Albert, with an
arm in it, has quietly stolen along the back of the
seat, and a strong brown hand rests tenderly on
the plump shoulder where it has a right to be. A
backward look through the car discloses a smile
on every face, but our new friends are busy with
the sunny prospects of the radiant world just
opening up to them, and have forgotten that they
are objects of interest. The Major leaning a little
toward me, whispers:</p>

<p>"I don't know just what you think of it, my
boy, but I hope it will always be sunny for them
to the end of the long trail."</p>

<p>From Hill-top, at the western side of the park,
our way is well up on the mountain sides along
well-timbered gorges. Presently, from the shelf
in the gray granite, one may look down into the
beautiful valley of the Arkansas. The pioneers
and familiars of the neighborhood will tell to this
day the delight they would feel on reaching the
summit over the old trail, whence they could look
into this vale. Sloping from the foot of what is
now called Mount Princeton down to the river, is
an emerald floor of six miles in width, skirted far
to the east by pine-covered mountains; the river
winds along the northerly side until it disappears
through a gorge in the distant hills. Beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Mount Princeton stand gray and solemn the massive
piles of Mounts Yale and Harvard, as if they
would shut out from intrusion and guard the
lovely valley in perpetual tranquillity. From our
vantage-point it seems quiet even now, with the
busy town just below. Before the advent of the
railroads and the multitude, one may understand
why the early miners looked upon it as another
dwelling-place of the Genius of Peace.</p>

<p>We lodge at Granite, one of the old mining
camps, prominent early "in the sixties," and with
golden prospects yet. I get a good bed in a room
that reminds me of old times; clean, eight feet
square, with a pipe running through the floor
from the office stove beneath. The pipe is not to
be despised, as an addition to one's bedchamber,
if one is unaccustomed to a sudden drop to 45°
from 90°. As I stand on the doorstep next morning
and take a survey of the town, no longer to be
called a camp, I conclude that it must have been
named Granite because there is less of that rock
here than anywhere else in the vicinity.</p>

<p>After breakfast, at which we taste our first trout
of the season, we start on a six-mile ride over a
splendid road to the lakes. Though we are fairly
in the heart of the mountains the way may not be
called mountainous; an exaggerated rolling prairie
surrounded by magnificent peaks gives a better
idea of the land. The air is fresh and cool, the
sun is bright, with no sign of clouds save in the
direction we are going. Reaching the mesa from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the valley a storm seems to be gathering about the
summits of the Twin Peaks and Mount Elbert.
Climbing the last rising ground between our starting-point
and destination, I find we are upon what
I conceive to be a terminal moraine, or the remains
of one, and can look down into the grand court
where the Ice King, at some remote date, held high
carnival; his throne, twenty or more miles away,
guarded on either side by peaks over fourteen
thousand feet in height; at my feet the ancient
floor of his palace, covering an area of six thousand
acres or more, no longer solid, but a pair of crystal
lakes flashing under the bright rays of the morning
sun. The July heat has not yet melted the
white helmets on the sentinels' heads, and back of
them the clouds I had seen but a little while before,
fleecy and drifting in the azure, are gathering volume
and blackness. Between them and me a gray
mist, driving earthward in perpendicular sheets,
tells of the rain coming down; the long lines
brushed by the breath of the storm will wave to
the right and left, and then drop again straight as
a plummet, while the sun's rays here and there
flash in the rainbow tints. The background of
the sullen clouds begins to pale a little, then
breaks, and a great mass of white and gray and
rose-tinted vapor rolls majestically to the left,
while the main storm, with its artillery in full
play, follows south, down the range, and once
more lets in the light upon the seat of ancient
royalty.<br /><br /></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">We catch only a few scattering drops while we
trot briskly around the south side of the lower
lake to the rustic hotel. The landlord takes possession
of my grip and I walk off alone to the
stream that holds in bond the beautiful lakes;
it is barely fifty feet wide by a hundred yards
long.</p>

<p>I put my rod together with a coachman on the
end of the leader. I had not taken time to soak
anything and the kinks were not out, but nevertheless
the fly had hardly touched the water before
I hooked a ten-inch trout. He gave up readily
and I lifted him out with an impression of a good
time at hand. But a half-hour's work disclosed
not another fin, and I concluded he was the last
one there.</p>

<p>Wandering toward the shore of the Upper Lake,
I overhauled a man with a cane pole and a bag.
I gave him my trout by way of encouragement, as
he said he was out of luck, and then I tried the
head of the outlet without avail. The man said
there were trout in the lakes, but the best way to
catch them was to row about with half a dozen
poles stuck out at different angles, and "hooks
baited with grasshoppers and such-like." I sat
on a rock and watched the tints of the Twin
Peaks and Mount Elbert mirrored in the smooth
water, and prayed for the destroyer, that if he had
not already overtaken the pot-hunter, he would;
and would burn, not drown him; toast him on a
fork and turn him around and toast him some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
more; toast him slowly just in sight of the cool,
clear waters he had helped to almost ruin. But
the government promises to establish a hatchery
here and to restock the waters. When that is accomplished
what more attractive spot can be
found in all these mountains for a summer sojourn
for wife, babies and your precious self? It can be
made a headquarters, if you wish, and thence you
may make easy runs farther into the wilderness.
With sweet air, pure water, grand scenery and
trouting, what more can mortal ask when he is
tired and the baby teething?</p>

<p>Though injured, the lakes are by no means depleted;
the fishing is not quite so gratifying as it
was twenty years ago, that is all. There are three
different varieties of native trout here: the red or
salmon-tinted, the lighter-colored variety, and a
slender, active trout, different from the denizens
of any other waters in the State except, perhaps,
Trapper's Lake. The back is a pale green, just
the color of the water in the lake, the lateral lines
are fine and black, and the spots perfectly round
and smaller than the finest shot; it is a graceful
fish in its contour, running to three-quarters of a
pound in weight, and possessed of excellent fighting
qualities.</p>

<p>The State has made an attempt at improving
the lakes, and I met the superintendent of the
State hatchery here. He said I must go a-fishing.
I asked him where, and he said on the lake, if I
was not disposed to take a run of a couple of miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
up to the falls, where the fishing was good. I told
him what I had heard, that the trouting was
nothing to boast of except as the market hunter
potted his game. To this he replied that when I
came to the lakes I must do as the lakers do. I
told him I had not had an oar in my hands for a
great many years and was in no humor to be
drowned. But he promised to attend to the rowing
while I fished. With this assurance and to
oblige him I rigged up, under his directions, four
pine poles, tied on the lines and fixed up a cast of
a coachman for a stretcher and a brown hackle
and a gray for droppers. I persuaded him to allow
me to take my bamboo, and armed with the
implements of torture and my rod, like Hyperion
among Satyrs, we stepped into a skiff and started
for the lower end of the lake. I stuck out those
pine poles with their ten feet of line, two over the
stern and one out each side, and sat on the butts.
The flies trailed along on the water and I had
room to ply the bamboo astern beyond the annoyances
floating there. After fifteen minutes of
this business, I asked the skipper if he did not
think a fellow who called this trouting, ought to
drown and go to&mdash;sheol. He laughed; I took to
praying again and in my earnestness lost one of
the poles. Shortly after I had a rise to the coachman
on the bamboo and hooked a trout. Inside
of two minutes I could not tell whether the fish
was on the hook that struck him, or the other
three lines, or whether I had four trout in tow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
I found out very soon that there was one trout
and four lines snarled. I pulled them all in, took
off the trout, untangled the knots and stowed the
poles. The man wanted to know whether I had
become tired and I told him I had, whereat he
proposed to tell everybody that I didn't know how
to fish. I said he would oblige me by circulating
the report, and that I was mortified only at having
tried. With this I sent the coachman astern again
and caught another trout; that was all; one trout
to the mile. Then I prevailed on him to row me
back to the landing at the hotel.</p>

<p>Looking down the lake after a little, I saw the
Major bending manfully to his oars and coming
home in grand style. When he reached us I discovered
among his other trophies of the afternoon,
two trout, one weighing four, and the other four
pounds and a half.</p>

<p>"You did not go far enough toward the east
shore," said the Major; "there is a place about
half a mile above the outlet, on that side, where
there is grass growing; I never failed in finding
good sport there; it is the home of these big salmon-colored
fellows. When you hook them they
make for the grass below; then, you know, you
have business in hand."</p>

<p>Later in the evening, while the Major and I enjoyed
our pipes and watched the light of the full
moon glimmering on the lake, he wondered what
had "come over the Deacon."</p>

<p>Our friend had evidently determined to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
another view of Manitou Park, and I informed
the Major of the Deacon's proposition to me.</p>

<p>"Ah! if he were only here!" sighed the Major;
"with the lake in front of him, and under this
moonlight, or with the shadows of the pines down
by the water's edge, and the melody of the miniature
breakers to whisper inspirations&mdash;eh! old
boy, maybe we should lose the Deacon&mdash;at least
for this trip," he asserted hastily, as if unwilling
to commit himself, against experience, and with a
knowledge that the sweetest things in life demand
a change. "They get tired of us, you know," continued
the Major.</p>

<p>"You talk as if the Deacon were in love."</p>

<p>"The symptoms are marked, my boy&mdash;he called
the other fellow a 'dude,' you say. It looks bad; I
fear he'll spoil the biscuit."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="p1 pn center mid">THROUGH THE SAGUACHE RANGE.</p>


<p class="pn p2">Much of the way from Granite to Leadville lies
close to the Arkansas, and with the level of it, the
river being but a few feet below the road. The
Major and I conclude to occupy the rear platform
and encounter an elderly lady on a camp-stool in
possession of the car door. She is here evidently
with a view to the scenery. As we squeeze past,
we are regaled with an odor of rose leaves, suggestive
of old-fashioned bureaus with obstinate
drawers, catnip tea and grandmotherly tenderness.
The velocity of the railroad train is not to be compared
to the speed with which the perfume flashes
one back through the decades, to the hard times,
and I detect a sigh from the Major as he seats
himself upon the car step.</p>

<p>"What are you sighing for, Major?"</p>

<p>With a hasty glance toward the car door: "For
the happy times of nearly half a century ago."</p>

<p>"And the rose leaves&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aha!" with a cheerful smile, "you caught the
fragrance too, did you, my boy?"<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-054.jpg" width="400" height="298"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Loop.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">Except for the rumble of the car wheels, silence
reigned for five minutes; the Major's meditations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
were finally interrupted by the appearance of Mr.
Dide, camp-stool in hand. The new arrival had
just taken his seat on the side next the Major
when the old lady exclaimed in a shrill treble:</p>

<p>"Land sakes! I believe in my heart that crick
is runnin' up hill."</p>

<p>Certainly from our level, and running in an opposite
direction, the current had that appearance
when looked at casually.</p>

<p>Mr. Dide turned toward the lady, stared, and
addressed her:</p>

<p>"Begpahdon! But weally that is not phenomenal."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"It is not unusual foah watah to wun up hill."</p>

<p>"Where was you born and bred, young man?"</p>

<p>"New Yauk."</p>

<p>They were both serious, the old lady, with her
head thrown a little forward and inclining to one
side, gazing at him over her glasses.</p>

<p>"What's your business?"</p>

<p>"I am a gentleman of lesyah, madam," and for
the first time something like a smile hovered about
the mouth of Mr. Dide.</p>

<p>"Evidently you was brought up that way&mdash;you
ain't married, surely?" with a manner implying
that though the world were full of feminine fools,
he had not discovered one foolish enough to enter
into the marriage relation with him. Mr. Dide
seemed discomfited, but rallied in a moment.</p>

<p>"Begpahdon! but you know the earth is not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
spheah but a spheaoid, flattened at the poles, and
the equatah is a dozen miles hiah than the surface
at the poles, and that some of the pwincipal wivahs
flow toward the equatah&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See here, young man, I don't know as I just
rightly understand what you're talkin' about, and
I don't think you do yourself. Seems to me you
must be one of them chaps that believes his grandfather
was a monkey, and lookin' at you I don't
know as you're to blame. I've raised nine children,
six boys and three girls, all married and settled
down 'cept Hannah&mdash;she's next to the baby,
and I don't know as she ever will; and if I'd had
one like you, indeed I'm afraid I'd a-flew into the
face of natur and set on him when a baby.
Where's your mother? you'd better go to her and
let her learn you not to talk to an old woman like
me as if I was a fool&mdash;there now!"</p>

<p>"Begpahdon, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, git away with your begp-a-h-don, as you
call it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, my deah madam&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But me no buts, and don't dear madam me.
I'll tell my Joshua and he'll shake that glass out
of your eye for insultin' his mother, he will."</p>

<p>Either the condition of Mr. Dide reflected in
the old lady's mind with his eyeglass gone, or his
general demoralization under the hands of Joshua,
mitigated her indignation; she laughed as she
bridled.</p>

<p>"Weally, madam," and Mr. Dide arose, held on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to the guard rail with one hand while he removed
his hat with the other, and with a manner that
went far toward making his peace, continued:
"I should nevah faugive myself if I went away
leaving you with the impwession that I intended
an insult&mdash;believe me, I am incapable."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;don't you try to make anybody believe
again that water runs up hill."</p>

<p>"I will not, madam, I assauh you."</p>

<p>"And don't talk as if you was swearin' every
time you say <i>ma</i>dam. Why don't you say ma'am
like a Christian?"</p>

<p>"I will mahm, with plesyah."</p>

<p>"That's right. Set down now, I want to see out.
I think somethin' might be made out of you with
a little trainin', though mebbe it's too late; 'as the
twig is bent the tree's inclined,' you know. What
do you carry that little umbrill for, that thing
you've got in your hand&mdash;don't you know the name
of it?"</p>

<p>"Ah, weally&mdash;to wahd off the sun and the wain."</p>

<p>"Land sakes&mdash;mebbe you think you're sugar
and'll melt; and you part your hair in the middle
like a gal; I see it when you had your hat off."</p>

<p>"Weally&mdash;please excuse me, I would like to
pass in."</p>

<p>"Set right down and don't let me drive you
away. I've taken an interest in you; where's your
mother?"</p>

<p>"Weally, ma&mdash;mahm&mdash;she has been dead many
yeahs&mdash;I can just wemember her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know'd it, and you've just been left to grow
up of your own accord; been to college of course.
'Squire Dodd he let his Jake go off to college, and
he staid just one year and come back with one of
them glasses and lost it next day; the ole 'squire
kep' him home after that, and set him to maulin'
rails in the patch down by the hemlock p'int&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>For half an hour the dear old soul held the disconsolate
gentleman in durance. I dared not look
at the Major but kept my eyes fixed on the landscape,
without seeing any of it.</p>

<p>Reaching Leadville, we searched in vain for the
Deacon; his lady friends were also absent, and the
Major remarked:</p>

<p>"The Deacon evidently is one point ahead in
the game. If he does not turn up in the morning
we shall be obliged to abandon him."</p>

<p>Leadville, that has added so many millions to the
wealth of the world, is more dignified than half a
dozen years ago; there is less of the revolver and
saloon and a little more of the church and the
Sabbath-school; no longer a mining camp, but a
city with only a tithe of its resources developed.</p>

<p>It reposes very quietly this Sabbath morning
under the bright sun. Turning from the range
at the north with its snow-capped peaks and looking
down the almost deserted avenue, I am reminded
of another Sunday morning&mdash;and it seems
only a little while ago&mdash;when the same street was
wont to be alive with humanity. Coming out of
an adjacent saloon a couple of young men faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
each other, blear-eyed and dishevelled; they had
plainly been making a night of it. Each stood
with his hand on his hip, while epithets, the most
choice in the camp vocabulary, flew thick and furious.
It might be dangerous or not; perhaps not.
But the innocent third party running away or
seeking shelter at the side might be in peril. I
took up a vibrating station, so to speak, immediately
in the rear of one of the would-be murderers,
and awaited the opening. It did not come, but
ended in froth and the appearance of an autocrat
with a star on his breast and a club in his hand.
He gathered in the bad men and was about to
possess himself of the undersigned, when I felt
compelled to explain the situation. He complimented
me by saying: "Your head's level," and I
was suffered to depart.</p>

<p>From the carbonate metropolis to the tunnel
through the Saguache Range the distance by rail
is perhaps seventeen miles, the difference in elevation
about thirteen hundred feet. To make
this distance one can hardly realize that one is
ascending, the grade is so light, winding on and
about the mountain sides. Lake Valley, with its
crooked band of water here and there widening
into silvery pools, and the gold and green of its
meadow-like spots, seems to be silently drifting
down and away. At the foot lies the city we have
just left, and beyond is the Mosquito Range. In
following the tortuous line the grand peaks seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
to change from one side of you to the other, all
the motion being with them.</p>

<p>Mount Massive gives you the aptness of its
name. You feel its magnificence as you approach,
and that it may be the glorious court of blue-eyed
Athena at whose vestibule you stand wonderingly,
and whence she issues to kiss the petals of the
wild flowers and endow the earth with health and
beauty. All about you are the pines, with here
and there a patch of aspens, their whitened trunks
set in banks of larkspur empurpling the sloping
mountain sides. Over deep gorges spanned by
threadlike trestle-work, you feel awed at the audacity
that planned and executed the way into
this solitude. High above the utmost peak of the
bulky mass, a spot no larger than your hand is
poised in ether, or moving, passes between you
and the sun, and you think perhaps of what Tennyson
says:</p>

<p class="pp1">
"He clasps the crag with hooked hands,<br />
Close to the sun in lonely lands;<br />
Ringed with the azure world he stands:<br />
The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls:<br />
He watches from his mountain walls,<br />
And like a thunderbolt he falls."<br />
</p>

<p class="pn">Or as Campbell puts it:</p>

<p class="pp2">
"And stood at pleasure, 'neath heavens zenith, like<br />
A lamp suspended from its azure dome,<br />
Then downward, faster than a falling star,<br />
He neared the earth, until his shape distinct<br />
Was blackly shadowed on the sunny ground."<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Hagerman Pass.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn p1">Or older still, as we find it in the Iliad:</p>

<p class="pp2">
"So the strong eagle from his airy height,<br />
Who marks the swans' or cranes' embodied flight<br />
Stoops down impetuous while they light for food<br />
And, stooping, darkens with his wings the flood."<br />
</p>

<p>The Major thought he would give Campbell the
benefit of his vote, though the old Greek tells us
the bird was a robber in his day as he is in ours.</p>

<p>The shriek of the whistle echoes and re-echoes
through the impressive silence; it startles you,
and you feel as if warned in a weird way by the
unseen spirits of these wilds, that you are an intruder.
Suddenly you are swept from the bright
sunlight, the lofty mountains and modest wild
flowers into utter darkness. Your dream of the
wise goddess may not be all a dream. You are
being hurled, in her anger, from the heavenly
heights to the depths of Erebus. Looking out,
you see mysterious shadows moving with lights
through clouds of smoke, and the lights burn dim
and red. There is comfort only in the reflection
that mortals have preceded us, and that we are
merely in Hagerman Tunnel<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and not knocking
at the gates of sheol.</p>

<p>In the ghostly light of the car lamp I discover
the venerable incubus of Mr. Dide, and inquire
what she thinks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Land sakes! it's flyin' in the face of the Almighty.
I suppose it's all right, but I kind o' wish
I was well out of it and with Joshua. I don't
know but I was a little hard on that young man
with the umbrill."</p>

<p>The Major, overhearing the wail, immediately
entered upon the office of comforter, and had but
fairly begun when, swish! and we were in the
broad daylight once again, on the western slope
of the Saguache Range.</p>

<p>There is a beautiful picture to the right; a few
miles away, down the mountain side, you catch a
view of a little lake, bordered by a strip of level
ground carpeted in gold; back of this grow the
pines, reaching on and up to the summits of their
homes, made dark and green; and away beyond,
delicately toned by the ever-present gray mist,
stands a lofty mountain range. The engineer is
kindly and pauses here, that you may have a
glimpse of the enchanting retreat, over the memory
of which you may dream when you are back
in the turmoil, and that will make you sigh for
the coming summer.</p>

<p>The character of the country through which we
are now winding our way down toward the valley
is more rugged than on the eastern side. The
thickly wooded slopes give place to more frequent
piles of granite, massive and gray. We come suddenly
upon a little park and find the haymakers
busy there, with a team of oxen, a motive power
already growing quite novel; a little further over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
where the gorge widens, affording a few acres of
comparatively level ground, we find the white
tents of the campers-out. There is a newness
about the cotton habitations that suggests experiment.
There are women in sun-bonnets and calico
gowns and a ruddiness of complexion no city air can
paint. Children with brown, bare legs scratched
by the briars, their cheeks tanned to a russet that
affords a contrast to the whiteness of their milk
teeth. And these jolly little fellows always greet
you with a broad smile and a hurrah that is without
feebleness or fever. Young men in long rubber
boots, helmet hats decorated with nondescript
flies and sporting an endless variety of trout rods.
All pause to look at the train, an act to which
they would rarely condescend at home. But this
one, maybe, brings accessions to their ranks from
the outside world, or a newspaper, and serves as a
link between what we call civilization and the
glorious freedom of the wilderness. A little
further on, standing upon the bank of a still reach,
we encounter a tall "lone fisherman," dressed in
overalls, a waistcoat ragged at the back, an old
white felt hat with the battered brim thrown up
from his face and drooping behind; in his hand a
long cane pole which it makes one's arms ache to
look at. But he will come in to-night with that
canvas bag swung from his shoulder well filled
with trout, and prove to you that the fishing is
good. Artificial flies are not indispensable with
him; grasshoppers when he can get them, bugs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
grubs, a bit of beef or a strip from the belly of his
first trophy of the day, will serve his purpose; he
is "after meat" and gets it. What could he do
with a fly and that walking-beam?</p>

<p>We reach a cañon whose sides at its mouth are
clothed with pines and aspens; the rocks have
changed from the granite to red sandstone and
great mountains made up of boulders and red clay.
The latter have been built here by the waters away
back in the untold centuries, and of whose abundance
the beautiful crystal stream now brawling
over its pebbled bed is but a thread. As the once
mighty force has cut its way through all impediments
and dwindled century by century to a narrower
channel, it has left exposed the great red
cliffs; falling still farther, soil has accumulated
on the more gentle slopes and has given these
Titanic piles broad bases of green interspersed
with wild flowers, and the delicate feathers of the
clematis here and there twine among the willows.
The winds and the rains have bestowed their aid
and carved the red mass into castles, buttressed
and pinnacled. And so, having traversed one of
the grandest gorges in the State and enjoyed a fair
view of some of the loftiest mountain peaks and
ranges, we slow up in the beautiful valley of the
Roaring Fork. The Major declared it was the
most delightful ride he had ever taken, and was
disposed to enthusiasm.<br /><br /></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="p1 pn center mid">JOSHUA.</p>


<p class="pn p2">While awaiting the departure of the train from
Aspen Junction to Glenwood Springs, one of the
dwellers in the neighborhood came up with a
string of beautiful trout, the largest of which
weighed two pounds. Where did he catch them?</p>

<p>"Why, right over yonder in the Roaring Fork;
lots of 'em; a fellow got one the other day that
weighed three pounds."</p>

<p>The manner of the informant defied contradiction
or doubt.</p>

<p>"Not improbable, my friend. I have landed
more than one five-pounder from that same water,"
said the Major.</p>

<p>"See here, mister, if I'd a-know'd you was goin'
to chip in I'd a-made it bigger&mdash;the last man hain't
no show, that's a fact."</p>

<p>"Honor bright, my friend; I camped here nineteen
years ago this summer; five-pound trout were
no rarity then."</p>

<p>The Major's tones carried conviction with them,
and, mollified, the native admitted he had "heard
of bigger ones up the fork."</p>

<p>The ride of twenty-five miles to Glenwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Springs completed our trip by rail. The next
business was to look up a man with a team and
wagon. We found him lingering over some old
circus posters on a bill-board down a side street,
which he seemed reluctant to abandon. He had
been recommended to us as a good cook, possessed
of a complete camp outfit, and to whom the whole
country was an open book.</p>

<p>Mr. Miles was a blue-eyed man of forty, perhaps,
with a hint of gray hairs about his temples,
broad-shouldered and wearing a pleasant smile.
He had been to Trapper's Lake times without
number, but he "couldn't get a wagon over the
trail."</p>

<p>"If you want to go by wagon, the best way is
round by Meeker, and up the White River; it's a
hundred and thirty miles, mebbe, while it's only
about a day's ride by the trail."</p>

<p>"By Meeker," was our route; we had come to
look at the White River Valley; we might return
to Glenwood by the trail.</p>

<p>"Meeker it is; then four dollars a day and you
find the grub and your own saddle-horses, or ride
in the waggin."</p>

<p>After assuring us that he would be back in an
hour with "everything ready to roll out for Newcastle,"
where we were to stop the first night, Mr.
Miles took his departure, singing in a delightful
tenor, "The sweet by-and-by."</p>

<p>Two hours elapsed and Mr. Miles had failed to
put in his appearance. We set out to hunt him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and found his cabin. It was a very neat cabin of
logs, hewed to the line, and a rustic porch covered
with a wild clematis vine made the place inviting
on a warm day. A couple of women in calico
gowns and sun-bonnets sat outside picking wild
hops from a vine which they had cut off at the
roots and brought in bodily. A youngster in slips,
regardless of the conventionalities of good society,
was standing on his head in the shade of the
chimney out of sight of the occupants of the
porch. The ground being sandy our approach
was unheeded by the women. The hands of one
were toil-worn, of the other slender and shapely,
but browned by the sun. The Major was about
to speak but was forestalled by the imp from the
chimney appearing, right side up, with the announcement:</p>

<p>"G'amma! here's men!"</p>

<p>The old lady's face, from her position, was first
to be seen, and revealed Mr. Dide's monitress.
The other was that of a young woman of twenty,
perhaps. As the child spoke the latter raised her
hands to the sun-bonnet, and turning toward us,
disclosed a very pleasant face with wonderful
brown eyes.</p>

<p>"Land sakes! if it ain't you; come in and set
down&mdash;Hannah, git some cheers."</p>

<p>The Major declined, as we were in a hurry, and
inquired for Mr. Miles.</p>

<p>"That's my Joshua, certain. He's gone to hunt
his horses; he's been hired to go out campin' with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
some tenderfeet, and they are out grazin'; but do
set down; this is my daughter Hannah," as the
young woman returned with the chairs, which she
burnished with her apron, though they were entirely
innocent of dust.</p>

<p>The Major felt obliged to repeat his excuse;
then pleasantly:</p>

<p>"I guess we are the tenderfeet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, you don't say!&mdash;Land sakes&mdash;but you
won't mind an old woman's nonsense, will you?
Set down, <i>do</i>; Joshua'll be here by-'m-by, he
greased his waggin just before he went; don't
mind the muss&mdash;me and Hannah's been savin'
these hops, they're better'n any store truck; they're
good for yeast; I never could 'bide salt risin' anyway,
and for neuralgie, I've suffered with that
some, so's Joshua, seems it's in the altitude, that's
what the doctors call it, and to my mind there's
nothing like a hop piller. Wish you'd set awhile."</p>

<p>The Major assured the good soul that we should
be delighted, but really we were anxious to start
and had a multitude of trifles to look after.
Would she be kind enough to request Joshua not
to delay longer than was necessary? and we bowed
ourselves away.</p>

<p>The sun went down and Joshua did not appear.
At ten o'clock we went to bed with the conviction
that we should have to abandon the namesake of
the potent commander. About the time we were
fairly asleep, he came and assured us, through the
door, that he would "be on hand at eight o'clock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
sure, with everything ready." That the horses
had "strayed and were not to be found until after
dark." We were prompt at the appointed time
and waited until nine. The Major was again about
to give him up, when he came around with a pair
of stout-looking mares and an empty lumber
wagon, and announced that he must "go and hunt
up an extra spring seat," as we had concluded not
to take saddle-horses. He came back in about
half an hour, with a seat lying in the wagon, and
said he had "a mind" to go after his bedding.
The Major suggested that he hurry.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be round, you bet."</p>

<p>At ten o'clock he returned with a roll of blankets
and we inquired after his camp outfit.</p>

<p>"By the great horn spoon&mdash;if I didn't forget all
about it; just hold on a minute," and he drove
off again. In the course of another half hour he
returned with a frying-pan and a broken skillet.
We inquired for the plates, cups, knives and other
articles supposed to be convenient in camp, including
the coffee-pot.</p>

<p>"Well, I lent my coffee-pot to a feller who's
gone prospectin' and I don't think he'll be back
inside of a week&mdash;you've got some canned beans
and such like&mdash;we can use the cans for coffee, and
have a new one every day, and I'm out of plates
and cups just now, though if I'd a-knowed it I
might 'a borrowed some of Jake."</p>

<p>The Major complimented him on this evidence
of cleanliness and economy, and then went off and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
purchased the necessary tinware and cutlery.
Joshua packed everything snugly and undertook
to adjust the borrowed wagon seat. It was found
to be too short.</p>

<p>"Well, I swan! but I'll git a seat if I have to
steal it&mdash;just hold on a minute."</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Miles," said the Major, "as it is
near noon, you'd better drive home and get your
dinner and the seat, and call for us in an hour."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll be round on time&mdash;hannup,
Woman, get on, Baby&mdash;we're not goin' to camp
here."</p>

<p class="pp3">
"'There's a land that is fairer than day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by faith we can see it afar,<br />
For the Father waits over the way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prepare us a dwelling place thar,</p>

<p class="pp4">In the sweet by-and-by.'"</p>

<p>"That man and his song match well," said the
Major, as Joshua disappeared around the corner
and the refrain died away, "'my dukedom to a
beggarly denier' he does not get back until too
late in the day to start. I wonder if he is not
trying to make an extra day in his count?"</p>

<p>At two o'clock he returned, but had not succeeded
in obtaining a seat. He stood before the
Major with eyes cast down and his forefinger on
his chin, evidently in deep communion with himself.</p>

<p>"I wonder, now, where I can get a seat&mdash;lemme
see&mdash;Bowers' got a waggin same as mine, but he
started yesterday with a load to Newcastle. Ben<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Soggs-no! his is broke. Lemme see&mdash;Pat
McGinnis&mdash;no, he's usin' his every day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suppose you buy one&mdash;is there not a wagon
shop in the city?" said the Major.</p>

<p>"Well, I swan! I hadn't thought of that&mdash;just
hold on a minute."</p>

<p>In the course of half an hour he returned with
the announcement that he had found a seat, but
the man wanted five dollars and a half, "second
hand, and that's a dollar'n a half more'n it's
worth, and&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Well, get it, we'll stand the dollar and a half."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;just hold on a minute."</p>

<p>It was three o'clock in the afternoon when we
started. We were blessed with several friends in
Glenwood; they manifested much interest in our
preparations for departure, and, as they had a
number of resident acquaintances, the sidewalk
was well peopled by the time we climbed into the
wagon. Looking over that sea of faces, as I remember
it now, every one was lighted up with a
broad smile, which resolved itself into a laugh,
with a hearty good-by and wishes for luck, together
with the request that we "leave some of the game
on the White," and would "not kill it all."</p>

<p>We smiled in return, and I felt that I should
be happy if Mr. Miles' shoulders were not so broad
and I had his head in chancery.</p>

<p>"Where do you propose camping to-night, Mr.
Miles?" inquired the Major as we reached the
bridge across the Grand River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lemme see&mdash;it's fifteen miles to Newcastle,
pretty good road, we can make that in three hours
with the load we've got; then it's about fourteen
miles to Rifle Creek, but there's muskeeters. We
might stop at Ferguson's, that's about ten miles
beyond Newcastle; that's a good place."</p>

<p>"But it will be quite dark by that time."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's a fact, it will be quite dark by that
time."</p>

<p>"Well, it is not very pleasant to make camp in
the dark."</p>

<p>"No, that's a fact; you're right about that&mdash;'tain't
pleasant to make camp in the dark."</p>

<p>"What will you do?"</p>

<p>"Lemme see&mdash;we was goin' to stop at Newcastle,
wasn't we? that's a good place."</p>

<p>"To camp, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, good place to camp, or there's a good
hotel&mdash;we might stop at the hotel over night and
take a fresh start in the mornin'."</p>

<p>"How far is it from Newcastle to Meeker?"</p>

<p>"Fifty-five miles,&mdash;hannup, Woman! we won't
camp here!"</p>

<p>"That's rather a long drive for one day?"</p>

<p>"You're right, it is&mdash;but we can make it, with
the load we've got&mdash;Baby! come out o' that!"</p>

<p>"It would be better not to try."</p>

<p>"You're right&mdash;we might camp at Morgan's,
t'other side of the Divide, if you want to, that's
more'n half way."</p>

<p>"Very well, we'll make Newcastle to-night, Morgan's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
to-morrow night, and reach Meeker the next
day&mdash;say at what hour?"<br /><br /></p>

</div></div>

<p class="p1">"Oh, anywhere before dark, easy."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see if you can make it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll make it, or break a trace!"</p>

<p>The "pretty good road" between Glenwood and
Newcastle had recently been traversed by a herd
of cattle and seemed the paradise of loose stones.
The Grand was muddy, as it frequently is, from
the mining on the Blue River and a recent storm.
But there is enough beauty in the scenery to compensate
one for the roughness of the road, which
Joshua seemed to make more rugged by hitting
all the rocks in the way.</p>

<p>When we reached Newcastle, Joshua drove up to
the hotel and the landlord put in an appearance.</p>

<p>"Why do you stop here, Mr. Miles?" inquired
the Major.</p>

<p>"This is a good place to stop, and I thought
you said you'd stop here to-night and take a fresh
start in the mornin'?"</p>

<p>"We purpose to have an outing, Mr. Miles, and
although the hotel may be excellent, we will go
into camp just below here on Elk Creek."</p>

<p>There was a decisiveness about the Major's tones
not to be misunderstood. Mr. Miles turned around
to get a better view.</p>

<p>"All right, just as you say&mdash;hannup, Woman!
Baby!"</p>

<p>He kept silent until we reached the creek, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
I made a remark about its beauty, then Joshua
broke out:</p>

<p class="pp1">
"Fresh from the throne of glory<br />
Bright in its crystal stream."<br />
</p>

<p>At the first verse the sternness vanished from
the Major's face; he could not resist the inclination
to laugh; the laugh was contagious; Joshua
turned in his seat with a look of inquiry, and halting
in his song, joined us.</p>

<p>"How d'you know the name of the creek,
Major?"</p>

<p>"I have been here before, Mr. Miles."</p>

<p>"Oh! How long you lived in this country,
Major?"</p>

<p>"Thirty years, next spring."</p>

<p>"No? Then you're a mossback sure enough&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp1">
'Tell me the old, old story,<br />
Of unseen things above'".<br />
</p>

<p>"Are you a member of the church, Mr. Miles?"</p>

<p>"Why, I ain't never just professed, exactly&mdash;what
makes you ask that?"</p>

<p>"Your familiarity with the Gospel hymns."</p>

<p>"Mebbe you don't like 'em&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite the contrary, Mr. Miles&mdash;I not only like
them, but your singing."</p>

<p>"Oh, give us a rest, Major&mdash;you can't blame me
for takin' you for tenderfeet with them knee-breeches."</p>

<p>"What did you pay for this wagon-seat, Mr.
Miles?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Four dollars,&mdash;honest Injun."</p>

<p>"I think we understand each other, Mr. Miles?"</p>

<p>"George Washington and his hatchet&mdash;I've felt
for some time's if I wanted to kick myself for
bein' a fool."</p>

<p>The footing being established, Joshua drew up
in a grassy spot near some scrub oaks.</p>

<p>"Just rest easy, gentlemen, till I git this team
unhitched, and I'll look after the supper, and put
up the tent while you're eatin' it."</p>

<p>"We have only a fly, and will not need that to night."</p>

<p>"That's an offset to the knee-breeches; if I'd
only knowed it! You don't care for a tent, even?</p>

<p class="pp1">
'The proper study of mankind is man'".<br />
</p>

<p>I suggested to the Major that he try the creek,&mdash;perhaps
he could get a mess of trout for breakfast.
He adopted the suggestion, and when we
called him, half an hour afterward, he came with
five good-sized trout. Not contented with his
success, after supper he went to the mouth of the
creek and hooked a pound-and-a-half fish, which
he brought in with much gratification.</p>

<p>Joshua seemed endowed with new life; he was
out of bed next morning and had breakfast prepared
before we were fairly awake; by seven
o'clock we were on the road. The coach on its way
to Meeker passed us shortly after we had started,
and would reach its destination by five o'clock.
Joshua admitted that he had more than once made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the trip in one day from Glenwood with a light
wagon and a good team.</p>

<p>The country between Newcastle and Rifle Creek
is blessed with spacious mesas covered with black
sage brush. Here and there these acres are under
ditch and cultivation, attesting that the uninviting
uplands, with the aid of water, can be converted
into beautiful farms. We crossed Rifle Creek, up
and over a broad mesa to Dry Rifle, and found ourselves
in a neighborhood by no means attractive.
Sage brush, cactus and greasewood, inhabited by
magpies and an occasional raven, do not tend to
inspire one with pleasant fancies. The soil is
adobe, the gulch contracted and hot, and water to
be thought of only; the sage brush had assumed
dignity and grown into trees. But the arroyo soon
widened and gave us a view of pleasantly wooded
low hills, and a cool breeze greeted us. The road
was good, and we trundled along in cheerfulness,
Joshua aiding at intervals with a lively air from
the Gospel Collection, or stimulating us with the
assurance that game was plenty "back among
them hills." We took a lunch about noon but
found the water warm and slightly impregnated
with alkali; at Morgan's, where we went into early
camp, the water was better.</p>

<p>After crossing the Divide, and before we
reached our camping-place, the country had improved
decidedly; the grass was fresher and more
abundant, and the wild flowers added to the attraction
of the slope along which we were travelling;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the distant hills were bountifully dotted with
aspen groves and openings&mdash;suggestive to one accustomed
to the haunts of deer. Gaps in the hills
immediately skirting our way would reveal small
parks, beautifully green, and the entrance to them
usually guarded by picturesque rocks. In one
of these projections a dromedary was conspicuously
outlined, with its head carried to the life.
In another a hippopotamus was wallowing up from
a sandstone bed. In another the form of a woman
half reclining in a high-backed chair, while immediately
in front was a figure in an attitude of supplication.
The afternoon sun shining fairly upon
this group gave us a good view of the features in
profile; other rocks immediately in front and to
the right of the principal figure, were readily constructed
into groups bearing a human resemblance,
and the Major at once gave the place the name of
the Queen's Court. Many have passed this way,
no doubt, and have seen a medley of rocks, while
others may have enjoyed with us the distinction
of an audience with royalty. Balancing Rock,
however, cannot escape the attention of the most
indifferent.</p>

<p>We finally caught a glimpse of a bit of the
White River Valley through the gorge toward
which we were moving: a beautiful stretch of
meadow-like land reaching up to timber-clothed
mountains. The view continued to expand until
we arrived at the border of the stream. The way
wound among willows and mountain beech, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
a few scrub oaks, now and then an alder bush,
and what Joshua termed haw bushes, bringing
us suddenly to the margin of the river. The
water was perfectly clear and cold, with the brush
growing close down to the edges of the banks; just
above the ford was a pool in which the Major was
as sure there were trout as that the sun shone.
It did seem, indeed, that the fish must find delightful
habitation in every foot of water in sight.
We crossed and made camp, and it was not long
before the Major verified his prediction. From
that same pool, within a hundred feet of the ford
where people were crossing nearly every hour of
the day, he brought in two trout that more than
sufficed for our supper.</p>

<p>"The stream is just alive with them, my boy&mdash;you
will have trouting such as you never had
before."<br /><br /></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="p1 pn center mid">ON WHITE RIVER.</p>


<p class="pn p2">Two miles, about, below our camp is that part
of the valley where the Ute Indian Agency was
situated a few years ago. Here it was that the
pot-bellied potentate Colorow and his horde of
tatterdemalions cruelly murdered agent Meeker,
captured and carried away women and children,
and committed other unprovoked atrocities&mdash;receiving,
as an inducement for further outrages,
additional government subsidies and comfort.
The soil which these "red brothers" refused to
cultivate now glitters in a garb of golden grain;
they killed their best guide and friend, who never
had for them other than kind words and fatherly
admonitions, because it required work to change
the product from sage brush to wheat. If a man
should undertake to harness an adult grizzly to a
plough the world would consider him weak and fail
to mourn his death, though he would be on a par
with the governmental "policy" touching the
Indian. A century of failure should, it would
seem, convince even a nation that there were defective
cogs in its policy wheel.</p>

<p>But the Major suggests that I drop the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
unless I desire to write a volume on a disease that
I cannot cure. He says it is like any other botch,
spoiled in the beginning of its existence, and it
would be impossible now "to lick into shape."</p>

<p>"It is only a matter of time when our 'red
brother' will cease to be, and our disgrace will
culminate at his final departure. We are out for
fish and our own reformation only."</p>

<p>Now that we are on the stream that we started
in search of, there is no occasion to hurry. We
have with us all the necessary accessories to comfortable
housekeeping; our time is our own, and
we enjoy a solid independence of landlords, railroads
or stage-coaches. A house would be an incumbrance
and finger-bowls as superfluous as a
piano. Do you know what it is to be free, absolutely
oblivious to care, past or prospective; with
no apprehension touching the condition of your
linen, the set of your necktie or the volume of
your trousers at the knees? If not, go camping.
The destitution of polish on your shoes and the
holes in your hat become luxurious, as you view
the one through the other while you lie on your
back in the shade and pull down the "old felt"
to screen your eyes from the brilliancy of the blue

<p>The next morning at breakfast the Major requested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
me to do the fishing for the day's supply;
he desired to go prospecting:</p>

<p>"You have not wet a line since we started; you
had an opportunity at Elk Creek and here, also,
last night. I thought you were fond of angling?"</p>

<p>"So I am, but catching fish does not constitute
my view of angling; it is only one of the pleasures
that awaits in the vestibule of the temple. A
beautiful attendant merely who induces us into
the inner sanctuary."</p>

<p>"We'll shake hands on that, my boy," exclaimed
the Major.</p>

<p>Joshua, who ate with us at our solicitation,
stopped his cup of coffee half way to his mouth
and stared at me.</p>

<p>"I'll get a gunny-sack full, if you want 'em,
Major,&mdash;can do it in half a day," said Joshua, sipping
his coffee.</p>

<p>"We would rather you did nothing of the sort,
Mr. Miles," and the Major's manner was somewhat
testy; "we could make no use of them&mdash;the time
of plenty is the time to save&mdash;you've heard that
before, no doubt, or something like it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've heard mother say that many a
time."</p>

<p>"I thought so&mdash;a mother's advice is always good,
and you can apply it to fish and other game."</p>

<p>"All right, just as you say."</p>

<p>The Major started off to the hills with his Winchester.
Joshua concluded he would stay around
camp and "square things up." One of the horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
had stepped on the new coffee-mill and ruined it,
and he must look out for another. The principal
feature of the new coffee-mill was a piece of clean
board about a foot square; the other part of the
complication consisted of a tin can. He placed
the coffee on the board and rolled it fine with the
can: the board, being the important part, in the
absence of carpenter shops and sawmills, was the
portion fractured, of course.</p>

<p>I put my rod together and adjusted the reel.
The leader and flies had been in soak for an hour
and were in good condition; I had selected a
coachman, a red-bodied gray hackle and a brown
cofflin to test in prolific water a theory of mine.
The White River in the fifty or more miles we experimented
is the ideal of a trout stream. From
our camping-place for thirty and odd miles to the
cañon of the South Fork is a series of riffles, deep
swirls under bushy banks, pools and comparatively
still reaches. The willows and other shrubs are so
thick that the opportunity for casting from the
shore is happily exceptional. There is no satisfactory
alternative but to pursue the best method.
The stones are clean beyond those in any stream
which I ever waded, and the prospect of a wetting
from smooth rubber boots and rocks a remote
possibility. To avoid the places too deep to wade,
crossing and recrossing the riffles becomes a necessity;
these opportunities seem to lie at such convenient
and appropriate distances that admiration
for the skill of the Designer is irresistible; one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
takes to the dancing crystal with a love for it, and
a reverence for its Presiding Genius. There is a
feeling of exultation as one enters and stands solitary
in mid-stream and looks down the flashing
current; the surging of the water, as it takes his
limbs into its cool embrace, whispers a greeting of
welcome; hid by the growth upon either side one
feels no longer alone, the water-sprites are with
him in loving communion and sympathy.</p>

<p>So standing and happily surrounded, I commissioned
the gray hackle, at the end of my leader, to
ascertain what might be lurking in the shade of
the opposite bank, where the current was swift
and the water four feet deep, at least. It was
taken at once, and inside of five minutes I had a
trout of a pound's weight safe in the landing-net.
As soon as possible after hooking him, I had
drawn away from his hiding-place and coaxed him
into shallower and quieter water, so that his neighbors,
if he had any, might not be disturbed. After
placing him in the creel, I changed the hackle for
the coachman and it was taken as readily, the fish
being a mate to the first. A third cast resulted
in a failure, a fourth brought a rise, a little more
line and at the fifth the fly alighted in the acceptable
spot, and was taken by a still larger fish.</p>

<p>Changing the coachman for the cofflin, I waded
down, close under the bushes of the right bank,
crossed a riffle and dropped the fly just where the
water slowed up a little, at the foot. It had
scarcely touched the surface when I saw the gaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
jaws of an apparent leviathan close upon it;
at the same instant I struck and the bamboo bent
to its work. A leap clear from the water advised
me that I had one of the lighter-colored variety
and consequently more of a fight on my hands.
Five minutes, however, at a guess, sufficed to bring
him into the net. He weighed, an hour afterward
by my pocket scales, a scant one and three quarter
pounds. I lengthened the line a little and brought
out another of nearly a pound. If the trout were
to keep up to these weights, for only a little while,
there would be waste in camp, and I wished for a
few smaller. But they did not come to me; either
of the next three would weigh three-fourths of a
pound, and going back to the slight opening in
the brush, through which I entered, I climbed out
and returned to camp.</p>

<p>Joshua received the creel and examined its contents.</p>

<p>"You and the Major seem to have the same
notions; I thought you would fill up that basket
and string a lot on a willer."</p>

<p>"There are quite eight pounds,&mdash;sufficient for
two meals."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but how do you manage to stop?
When the fish bite that way I want to catch 'em."
Thereupon I read a homily to Joshua on the
art of angling, at the conclusion of which he said
he understood what I had told the Major in the
morning about the "inner sanctuary."<br /><br /></p>

<p class="p1">"That is, I have an idea about it&mdash;mebbe I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
try it some day; but this is such a dog-on hard
world to get along in and buy shoes for the baby!
I'm afraid I can't get into your way&mdash;a fellow
can't live on scenery, you know, and 'tain't easy
for old dogs to learn new tricks. But I'll try and
not make a trout hog of myself, as you call it,
anyway&mdash;I think I can manage that much."</p>

<p>He went off with my fish and creel toward the
river, singing, and I flattered myself on having
made a partial convert.</p>

<p>Just before noon the Major returned, warm and
tired, and sought solace of his pipe. He brought
with him two willow grouse with their heads shot
off. He had found a coal mine in the bluffs above
us, near the town, and had discovered other flattering
indications of future wealth for those inclined
to pick them up. He had also started two
deer, "within fifty yards," during his tramp.</p>

<p>"Where are they?" inquired Joshua.</p>

<p>"Over in those hills, I presume," answered the
Major, with a nod toward the supposed locality.</p>

<p>"Why! didn't you kill nary one?"</p>

<p>"Nary one."</p>

<p>"Well, I swan&mdash;what's the good of carrying a
rifle?"</p>

<p>"What's the good of killing what you don't
need?"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, excuse me, I don't mean any offence,
but I'm durned if you ain't the queerest
pair of cranks in the huntin' and fishin' way, I
ever see. I don't know, but mebbe you're right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
about it, still I can't get it through my hair. Of
course, I don't believe in wastin' meat, <i>but</i>, I'd a&mdash;<i>had</i>
to shot them deer."</p>

<p>"Mr. Miles, you ought to live where there is one
deer to a township and a trout to a mile of water&mdash;you'd
change your mind and want to hang the
man who talked as you do."</p>

<p>"How'll you have the grouse cooked, Major&mdash;stewed
or fried?"</p>

<p>"Either way."</p>

<p>Joshua served them up to us roasted, and they
were delicious.</p>

<p>Loitering by the road later in the afternoon I
saw the coach on the opposite side of the river,
before it came down into the bottom-land. There
was a passenger on the box with an umbrella. I
waited and recognized Mr. Dide, who had added
a fishing-rod to his luggage.</p>

<p>"Weally!&mdash;dwivah, stop a moment. I am delighted
to see you; do you live in the vicinity?"</p>

<p>I informed him that the camp was just below,
and we should be pleased to have him call.</p>

<p>"Chawming&mdash;thanks; I shall be delighted to
drop in."</p>

<p>He did so, just before supper, very much to the
astonishment of Joshua and the surprise of the
Major. I had forgotten to apprise my friend of
the new arrival and of the invitation I had extended.
I also confessed a little wonder to myself
at the gentleman's prompt fulfilment of his promise,
but was none the less gratified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have heard" (it is impossible to spell the
word as he pronounced it) "of Meekah, you know,
and the twouting, and thought it would be quite
novel to wun ovah. The wide was not vewy inviting,
but this is chawming&mdash;think so?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dide was so truly delighted with the novelty
of his experience, and so full of anxiety to make
it known, that he was permitted to run on without
interruption. Hitherto he had seemed reticent,
now he was overflowing in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"I've nevah twouted, you know, but I shall twy.
I bought a pole and some widiculous-looking
flies."</p>

<p>The Major suggested that I knew something
about the sport, and would, no doubt, assist him
in gratifying his ambition. Of course I would,
and did. My office of mentor was not devoid of
pleasant incidents. He was to call in the morning,
with his tackle, and did so immediately after
breakfast. He was not prepared to wade, and I
borrowed the Major's boots without leave. The
rod was a cheap specimen of ash and lancewood,
and the dealer had been fair with him in the
matter of line, leaders and flies. The Major will
bring down the scales at two hundred, Mr. Dide
at one hundred and twenty-five pounds, at a guess;
in the Major's boots Mr. Dide, I must confess, appeared
at a disadvantage. I adjusted his tackle,
even to the winding of the line on the little brass
reel above the grip, and led the way to the scene
of my own recent exploits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Dide, upon entering the water, affirmed
that it was cold; there was no gainsaying his assertion.
He expressed a doubt of his ability to
keep his feet, and I endeavored to assist him.
He tossed his fly in the direction I suggested, allowed
the point of the rod to drop and the fly
floated at the edge of the swirl. I admonished
him to hold his rod up; at the same instant a
trout hooked himself, the little reel spun round
and Mr. Dide exclaimed in great exultation:</p>

<p>"I have got him! I have got him!"</p>

<p>"But you will not keep him long, Mr. Dide, if
you do not check the line."</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;but I cawn't, you know&mdash;oblige me!"
and he held out his umbrella toward me. The
trout in the meantime was having his own way;
the line was fast disappearing from the reel; suddenly
it slacked, his troutship was returning, and
rapidly. I supported Mr. Dide by seizing the
back of his collar with one hand and relieved him
of the umbrella, directing him to reel in the line.
The fish was without doubt fatally hooked. Mr.
Dide, laboring at the crank with a vigor that
would have given a hundred revolutions a second
to an ordinary grindstone, succeeded in retrieving
the slack. As he did so the fish gave a leap half out
of the water, and a struggle that brought the butt
of the rod in contact with the fisherman's stomach.
Something snapped&mdash;it was the tip. Still the
hook held, the line could be trusted; if the leader
and snell proved true the fish might yet be saved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
I directed Mr. Dide to give no more line, but simply
to hold the remains of his rod firmly and to
stand still, if he could. He endeavored to follow
instructions, and I took up my station a little
lower down and to one side in shallower water,
watching the brave exertions of the quarry to free
itself. I bethought me that the umbrella, in the
absence of my landing-net, might be put to profitable
use. As the fish came my way I suddenly
scooped him up from behind, together with an umbrella
nearly full of water; the trout went over
the edge some time before I could empty the novel
device.</p>

<p>"That's the most extwaawdinawy pwoceeding I
evah witnessed!" exclaimed Mr. Dide.</p>

<p>Certainly it was beyond anything in my own
experience. I concluded that the only way to
save the fish was to get to the bank. Mr. Dide
declined my offer to take his rod, for which I
commended him, but he was doubtful of his ability
to stem the current and manage his tackle without
my assistance, so I led him ashore and he dragged
the trout. Seizing my opportunity, when the
nearly exhausted victim was quiet, I lifted him
out by the leader. He had hooked himself
through the tongue, and so deeply that, notwithstanding
his struggles, the wound was but little
enlarged, and the use of a knife was required to
release him.</p>

<p>Mr. Dide was so much delighted at his success
that the damage to his rod was a matter of little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
importance. He would have continued to fish
with the remains of it, but that I convinced him
of the impossibility of casting a fly without a tip.
He returned to camp and soon came back with the
extra one. I concluded to prospect for openings
in the brush. Having found one with a promising
little eddy below it, I indicated the best place, in
my judgment, at which the fly should be delivered.
Mr. Dide undertook the feat and the fly caught in
the willows behind him. I released it and the
next effort resulted in a good hold upon the umbrella,
which the gentleman insisted upon keeping
over his head. I was constrained to advise him
that the umbrella would better be put aside; he
surrendered it to me hesitatingly, as if he might
be at a loss without it. He splashed the fly into
the water within a rod of the place I had suggested,
but that was of no importance; a trout took it in
a moment and in the next was flying high in air
and eventually became entangled in the brush. I
wondered whether first efforts were ordinarily attended
with the results I had witnessed, or whether
my <i>protégé</i> were specially skilled in awkwardness.
After he had placed me and my apparel in jeopardy
several times I took the rod and endeavored to
show him how to make a cast; then I did not
blame him so much. But he felt encouraged, and
I betook myself to camp, leaving him to work out
his own salvation. He came back before noon
with the two trout; his rod was broken again and
he was very wet, having evidently been up to his
neck in water.<br /><br /></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="p1 pn center mid">ON THE SOUTH FORK.</p>


<p class="pn p2">The particulars of the disaster to Mr. Dide and
what led up to it were brief:</p>

<p>"I hooked a vewy big twout&mdash;he would have
weighed ten pounds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, Mr. Dide&mdash;&mdash;" interrupted the Major.</p>

<p>"Pon honah!"</p>

<p>"The speed with which you have become proficient
as a fisherman is something marvellous, Mr.
Dide. Ten-pounders in this water are not within
the memory of the oldest inhabitant."</p>

<p>"Weally, he was twice as big as the one we
hooked this mawning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then he must have weighed not quite three
pounds, Mr. Dide. The only sure way is to catch
your fish and weigh him on the scales."</p>

<p>"Major! Major! think of the penalty provided
against that sort of wit."</p>

<p>"It was not so intended, I assure you, my boy."</p>

<p>"But, weally, he must have weighed moah than
thwee pounds, Majah, he was so big and he smashed
the pole, you know! I hooked him, and he stwuggled
violently for a gweat while, and when I sought
to pull him out the pole bwoke; he lay on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
watah and I sought to secuah him by going in
myself and catching him in my hands; it was
vewy cold, 'pon honah; he moved away and I followed
him into a hole, but he eluded me."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, you're quite as intrepid as Kit
North. You will make an angler, certainly."</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;vewy much delighted, I assuah you.
I have been devising another method of casting
the fly, majah. I find it vewy difficult, and it
makes my ahms ache. I think I will take a piece
of aldah and make a pop-gun and pop the fly out.
Did you evah twy it?"</p>

<p>"I never did; with the pop-gun and umbrella
you will revolutionize the science of angling."</p>

<p>"No? weally? But the umbwella was not my
device, you know," Mr. Dide modestly protested.</p>

<p>"Still, you made the project possible."</p>

<p>"Think so?"</p>

<p>"Do you shoot, Mr. Dide?"</p>

<p>"Aw, a little. I have pwacticed some with a
Winchestah, at a tawget, you know."</p>

<p>The Major deemed it advisable to admonish the
gentleman that it would be well for him to seek a
change of clothing, or at least to wring out his
garments and hang them on the bushes to dry.
The latter part of the suggestion was rejected as
impossible&mdash;"somebody might come, you know"&mdash;notwithstanding
the Major offered him the use
of a rubber coat during the emergency. Mr. Dide
therefore trudged off toward the town, leaving an
impression, to one ignorant of the cause, that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
miniature sprinkler had just passed over the road.
After his departure I informed the Major that the
gentleman had intimated a desire to accompany
us during the remainder of our trip.</p>

<p>"If you can stand it, I can, my boy."</p>

<p>We broke camp and passed through Meeker
early the following morning. The town&mdash;the site
of the old military post&mdash;is pleasantly situated on
a level place in the valley, skirted on one side by
low hills and on the other by the river, from which
rises a steep bluff; on the summit of this stands
the remains of an adobe signal station, profiled
against the background of sky. There is a square
in the town, and surrounding it the adobe buildings
erected by the government, but now utilized
by the peaceful citizens as dwellings or stores.
Indians are not presumed capable of bombs, mortars
or big guns, and, of course, in selecting a
military post with a view to their methods and
capabilities a valley with water is better than a
hill-top without. The country is rich with ripening
grain, and every available acre is either being
prepared for cultivation or is actually under tillage.
The mountains that border all this valley are low
and many covered with timber to their summits.
Between the gaps of the closer hills one may discover
glades opulent in pasturage.</p>

<p>Near noon we lunched at an excellent spring a
little way from the forks of the river. We were
overtaken here by Mr. Dide on horseback, for
whom we had left, at the hotel, an invitation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
join us. He had provided himself with a new rod
and a pair of blankets. What the settlers thought
of a man on horseback, with a glass in his eye and
an umbrella over his head, riding through the
country, has not yet transpired. He had experienced
some difficulty at the start; the horse, objecting
to the extraordinary equipment of the
rider, had endeavored to throw him off, but failing
in that, ran away. The dogs also had added to
his discomfiture by making frequent sorties,
threatening his legs and vociferously assailing the
heels of his steed. Mr. Dide had, however, survived
all impediments and came up smiling.</p>

<p>The valley of the South Fork is somewhat narrower
than that of the main river through which
we had come. The brush marks the course of
the stream on the left, and beyond it the mountains
rise gradually for perhaps two thousand feet,
while to the right they reach about the same altitude.
The aspen groves are abundant, their
lighter green foliage being interspersed with the
darker hue of the pines, clothing the sloping hillsides
from the base to the summit. The road is
smooth and we can trot the horses readily. At
times we are close to the river and again half a
mile away. Coming to a great clump of bushes on
the left, a family of willow grouse was flushed
from the grass near the road-side; there were six
in the flock, and the major potted four of the
young ones, they having alighted in the adjacent
trees. We had gathered up the birds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
gone but a little way when Joshua cried out excitedly:</p>

<p>"Look at her! look at her! right ahead there,
in the road. Where's the rifle&mdash;gimme the rifle!"</p>

<p>Not two hundred feet from us stood a magnificent
doe, broadside on, and an easy shot for the
veriest tyro that ever pulled trigger. Instead of
bringing the rifle to bear or giving it to Mr. Miles,
the Major waved his hat and shouted. The beauty
ceased staring at us and bounded away gracefully
toward the aspens on the right.</p>

<p>"What'n thunder!&mdash;Major! you do beat all,
that's a fact. Did anybody ever see such a pretty
shot!" exclaimed Joshua regretfully and with an
expression of disgust.</p>

<p>"Mr. Miles, you should understand, as well as
the rest of us, that it is against the law to kill does
at this time; it is the close season, and I have no
doubt she has a suckling fawn hid not a hundred
yards away. We'll have no law-breaking; if we
need venison we will take one with horns, not kill
the mother and leave the babies to starve. Think
of it, man; think of the cruelty of it!"</p>

<p>"Hannup, Woman! ga'lang, Baby," was the
only response from Joshua. It came with vigor;
disgust pervaded his entire system. We passed
the clump of willows, when Mr. Dide, who was
trotting along behind, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Aw, Majah! look theah."</p>

<p>Turning, we saw a buck that had just made its
way out of the cover, running swiftly across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
road and making for the mountain side. Joshua
brought down his whip upon the horses with his
usual admonition to them, but given in a tone
that indicated a determination to eschew venison
or even the thought of it. The Major smiled with
the satisfaction of a man who realizes having made
an impression. Reaching the foot of a slight rise
the horses were permitted to slacken their pace,
and silence reigning at the time, Joshua broke out
with one of his familiar hymns:</p>

<p class="pp1">
"Almost persuaded."<br />
</p>

<p>"I would rather you were fully persuaded, Mr.
Miles," said the Major when the singer had concluded
the first stanza.</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;here she goes."</p>

<p>Joshua seemed to rise to his best effort, and was
unexpectedly joined by Mr. Dide in an excellent
bass.</p>

<p>"Well!" said the Major, as the song was concluded,
"our lines seem to have fallen in pleasant
places, sure enough. I was not aware of the hymn,
however."</p>

<p>"If all the hunters that come over here lived up
to your way, Major, we'd have to kill the deer in
self-defence."</p>

<p>"You believe, however, that my way is the right
way, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do&mdash;hannup, Woman."</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon we came to what is known
as the "Still Water." A subsequent examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of this place in the stream impressed me as being
caused by the peculiar formation of the bed-rock.
An idea of it may be imparted by taking a dozen
shingles and laying them on a level, as you would
upon a roof, with the butts lapping a couple of
inches only. Consider this the bed of a river with
the water flowing over it from the thin end of the
shingles, the butts being from three or four feet
to ten in thickness. At each butt, or where the
rock breaks abruptly, there is a scarcely perceptible
motion of the water; immediately beneath is a
deep hole, growing shallower as the next butt is
reached; then follows another hole; there are several
miles of this water in which the current is
barely noticeable; the banks are four and five feet
from the surface, which is as smooth as glass. The
willows grow thickly on both sides of the stream,
with breaks at intervals that give one access to it.</p>

<p>Joshua, who was familiar with the vicinity, pronounced
Still Water "a dandy place to fish," but
we did not stop, except to permit the Major to
possess himself of two more grouse, the birds being
abundant. We made camp before dark near the
mouth of the cañon.</p>

<p>Immediately opposite is a perpendicular bluff
of rocks two hundred feet high, or more; slight
projections here and there in the face of it serve
as footholds for a few hardy bushes, a cluster of
wild flowers, or a matted vine; nearer the summit
are dwarfed pines. The river sweeps along the
foot of this wall; distilled from its near mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
springs, it is as clear as crystal, and, dashing from
the shadows of the adjacent cañon, is, as Mr. Dide
expresses it, "<i>vewy</i> cold." On the side of the river
where our camp lies the valley extends very gradually
up and back to the neighboring hills. The
grass is bountiful and rich, and we have a cluster
of young pines under which we may lounge in the
heat of the day. Looking down the course of the
river the valley becomes wider, and we have an
open view of mountains and green slopes for miles.
At our first night's camp in this secluded spot,
when the fire has burned low and casts fitful
shadows against the opposite cliff, we find ourselves
with our feet due north as we lie in our
blankets. There is a peculiar charm in the bed
of fragrant twigs, with nothing to shut off our
vision of the fretted roof. We may gaze out of
our shadowy environment into the faces of the
bright gems and hold hallowed communion with
their mysteries. The liquid voices of the Naiads
in their revels sweep gleefully toward me and
then away again in softest cadence. The north
star and the Dipper grow bright, then indistinct,
then revive and grow dim again, as the gentle
sprites brush my eyelids tenderly with their downy
wings and soothe me into sweet forgetfulness.
Some time in the night I awoke; the Dipper had
moved, or rather we had moved, and the constellation
was no longer in sight. The silence was
broken only by the heavy breathing of my nearest
companion, the Major, and the hymn from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
river. As its notes rose and fell its somnolent
influence took me gently in charge again. The
"to-hoo&mdash;to-hoo" of an owl interrupted the spell
for a moment; I saw him in my mind's eye solemnly
staring into the darkness, and I was gone
before he had concluded the second call.</p>

<p>When I awoke again it was daylight and I raised
on my elbow to take in my fellows. Joshua lay
rolled in his blankets under the cluster of pines.
Mr. Dide looked thin and singular without his
eyeglass. His nose had reached the peeling stage
under the influence of the sun, and was decorated
with ragged bits of skin, as if it had been caught
in a shower of tattered tissue-paper. The Major,
with his hat tied over his head, bore marks of the
out-door life and slept like a child. I turned out
quietly, as the sun crept over the hills, slanting its
glad rays against the opposite cliff, and when they
touched the swirling water at its foot, I put my
rod together, with a coachman on the end of the
leader, and walked a dozen paces to a little gravel bar.</p>

<p>I had never before tried the denizens of our
mountain streams at so early an hour, and was
doubtful of securing anything for breakfast. I
sent the coachman over into the swirl and hooked
a trout at once; landing him safely, I tried for the
second and secured him. Just below me a few
rods the river made an abrupt bend, and a great
boulder there had accumulated a quantity of drift,
under which was a promising pool. I tried the
pool with flattering success, landing three fish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
either of which would weigh half a pound. Another
cast, a little nearer a log that constituted
the main support of the rubbish, and a beautiful
salmon-tinted trout rolled up to the fly and was
caught. The water was swift, and he caused me
some uneasiness by making directly for his lurking-place;
if he ever reached the snags that had
heretofore afforded him shelter, or the line should
foul in the vibrating branches of some drift that
swung in mid-stream between us, he was no longer
mine. To keep him from his hiding-place I took
the risk of refusing him line, merely dropping the
point of the rod a little in his more violent struggles;
to avoid the nearer brush I went into the
water and succeeded in getting below that difficulty.
I realized Mr. Dide's conclusion of the
temperature, and felt that his adverb was altogether
inadequate&mdash;a dead failure, in fact; it demanded
adjectives in quantity and force. The
water reached my knees, and I feared if it rose any
higher I should be compelled to take to the bank;
rubber boots afford some protection in such emergencies
and temper the chill. I had only a light
pair of old shoes devoted to camp use in dry
weather. Having attained an advantageous position,
I succeeded in coaxing his troutship completely
away from danger into slower water, and
learning that he was securely fastened, I had no
apprehension of the result. I allowed him to
fight until he was quite exhausted, and then drew
him up to and upon the small bar at the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
which I had been standing. I must weigh him,
surely, then and there; and by the pocket scales
he brings down the indicator to two pounds and
two ounces, and, for "a red feller," he had offered
more than ordinary resistance.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="p1">There was an abundance for breakfast, and
twenty minutes had sufficed to cover the time
from my leaving the camp. I gathered up my
spoils, strung them on a willow twig and returned.
The sleepers had not changed their attitudes, and
I gave them the benefit of a morning bell after
the manner of an Indian war-whoop. The Major
merely opened his eyes, Mr. Dide was startled, and
Joshua took in the situation calmly.</p>

<p>"Arise, ye sluggards, and see the result of twenty-minutes'
work on the South Fork of the White!"</p>

<p>"I'll discount that before noon," said the major,
throwing off his blankets.</p>

<p>While the Major and Mr. Dide made their way
to the water's edge with soap and towel, Joshua
appealed to me confidentially. He wanted to know
why the Major had brought "that Winchester."</p>

<p>I suggested that he might have intended it for
bear.</p>

<p>"But see here, now, can't you persuade him to
kill a deer, or to let me have the rifle? I see that
he keeps the ca'tridges fastened up in that box of
his, or stowed in his pockets."</p>

<p>Plainly the Major and Joshua understood each
other upon the question of game, but I consoled
him by agreeing to comply with his wishes.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="p1 pn center mid">SPORT.</p>


<p class="pn p2">Within two miles of us was a ranch, where we
knew there were several men. While discussing
breakfast, I prefaced my request to the Major by
intimating these facts, and hinting that a taste of
venison would serve as a change from trout and
grouse. The Major looked at me and then at
Joshua, who was busy over the fire, but attentive.</p>

<p>"Those men will help us dispose of a deer, if
you get one."</p>

<p>"Very likely, if they haven't got a supply on
hand."</p>

<p>"Suppose you inquire."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll think of it," looking again in Joshua's
direction.</p>

<p>"If you'll just leave some of them ca'tridges
where I can lay hands on 'em, I'll get some venison,"
Joshua broke in, giving a trout in the frying-pan
an extra turn and pressing the centre down
with his knife.</p>

<p>"No doubt," and the Major's visage relaxed into
a smile.</p>

<p>"You bet I will. I can't see the use of havin'
deer runnin' all over and never a shot fired; there's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
a difference between supplyin' your wants and
wastin'."</p>

<p>When the meal was concluded the Major shouldered
his rifle and sauntered off toward the cabin
of the settler. He returned in the course of an
hour, with the announcement that the men would
"not mind" taking a little meat; they had been
too busy for a few days past to do any hunting.
They would not object to a few trout, as well, if
we had them to spare. This was good news.</p>

<p>"Those men have trapped and killed four bears
during the past few days," said the Major.</p>

<p>"Where'bouts?" inquired Joshua quickly.</p>

<p>"Just up there in the timber a couple of miles.
The bear killed a horse, and the men have been
after the bear with pretty good success."</p>

<p>"I should say so&mdash;mebbe I'll go up and see 'em."</p>

<p>"Better not, without a gun."</p>

<p>"That's so&mdash;mebbe there's more around," murmured
Joshua; "I've no notion goin' up there and
roostin' in a tree." In a few moments he broke
out with a song which we had not heard from him:</p>

<p class="pp1">
"The Lord will provide."<br />
</p>

<p>"I've heard that He 'helps those who help
themselves,'" said the Major.</p>

<p>"Look here, major, haven't I been tryin' to help
myself for a week and can't?"</p>

<p>There was something irresistibly ludicrous in
the pathetic appeal that set us all laughing, including
the promoter of the merriment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will try for one in the morning, Mr. Miles,
or you may go if you can get back in time to prepare
breakfast."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll get back in time, you bet."</p>

<p>As it was after nine o'clock, the Major said he
would go up the cañon a little way and catch a
few trout. I was to look after the advancement
of Mr. Dide; I prevailed upon him to leave his
umbrella in camp, and took him and his new rod
under my supervision. The gentleman gave indications
of improvement, and I persuaded him to
the pool with the drift. After several ineffectual
efforts he succeeded in throwing his fly beyond
the brush in mid-stream, and hooked a trout that
the next moment had the line entangled. He was
without waders, and I did not propose to swim in
that cold water for the sake of saving another
man's leader. I took the rod, but finding gentle
manipulation unavailing, I gave the line a pull
and broke the snell only. Bending on another
fly, I advised him to work his way through the
bushes and reach the little bar where I had landed
my last trout. By that means he could cast up
toward the pool and would avoid at least one pile
of brush. When he was fairly stationed I went
back to camp, took my bamboo and worked my
way down to the water at the mouth of the cañon.</p>

<p>A likely place presented itself a few rods above;
I crossed a riffle and made my way to it on a beach
of gravel about three feet wide. The pool was
quite deep on the farther side and the bottom descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
somewhat abruptly from the bar, so that
I could not get more than eight feet from the
bushes behind me without going over my boots.
It was a difficult place to cast from, with even
twenty feet of line, without catching the bushes,
but I managed to get the fly away, after a fashion
not satisfactory. It seemed the rule, however,
that no matter where or how the fly landed, except
on the shallow riffles, a trout was almost certain to
put in an appearance. In the clear and smooth-flowing
water in front of me, I saw a dozen beautiful
fish; the one nearest the fly came up and took
it. I soon landed him on the beach and tried
again. We had made some stir, but it had no appreciable
effect on the others, and I had another
fastened in a few moments. This sort of angling
has its disadvantages to the lover of the gentle art;
it is too apt to curtail the measure of his enjoyment;
he absorbs in half an hour a fund that, to
be correctly appreciated, should consume double
the time.</p>

<p>Instead of casting again at once, I stood watching
the well-to-do citizens. One and another
would rise to the surface, take in something I
could not discern and settle back again; their existence
seemed to be one of ease, as of mortals
who had inherited or secured a competency, and
were disposed to indolence. They moved with a
dignity characteristic of high breeding. If one
started in quest of a floating morsel his nearest
neighbor courteously bowed him on, as it were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and with a graceful wave of his caudal said plainly:
"Oblige me by taking precedence." Seeing one
larger than his mates behind a small rock, I sent
the coachman in his vicinity. Two started, but
the smaller one halted&mdash;it was age and beauty
before beauty alone. Age with its wisdom declined
and settled back, beauty and inexperience came
forward again and was lost to his crystal world.</p>

<p>Was this experience of the one who refused
greater than could be encompassed by human subtlety?
I was a little piqued, perhaps, at the indifference
manifested. He might be a hotel clerk,
a justice of the peace or some other dignitary
metamorphosed.</p>

<p>I lighted my pipe, sat under the shade of the
mountain beeches, smoked and reflected. An ousel
came suddenly round the elbow of the river and
alighted in the edge of the water a few yards away.
He bobbed up and down a few times, said something
to himself and took a running dive for a
few feet along the margin of the bar, came out
again, bobbed and spoke, as though he might be
rehearsing for some water-wagtail entertainment,
then took another dive. Presently a second one
came round the same course, pleased himself and
me with an exhibition precisely like that of his
predecessor and finally disappeared.</p>

<p>I changed the coachman for a gray hackle with
a peacock body and stepped into the edge of the
pool. "The deformed transformed" had resumed
his station behind his desk, and I put the temptation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
in his way. He could not resist it; he had
his price and I had ascertained its maximum; a
very trifle indeed, the veriest fraud as usual, compounded
of tinsel and feathers, appealing first to
the eye, then to the palate, arousing his dormant
wicked propensities, tickling not the least of these&mdash;his
avarice. I felt, I must confess, a symptom
of contempt for him, as the sting of death touched
his lips. I watched him struggle, feeling something
approaching vicious exultation. I could
not, however, but admire his efforts to rid himself
of the consequences of his folly. Repentance, if
he experienced it, came too late; the inexorable
hand of the fate he had courted was closing upon
him. He must have said to himself, at intervals,
while he lay gasping: "If I were only safe out of
this&mdash;I would never put on airs again&mdash;to excite
the pride of the most humble of creatures."
Resignation, however, was not one of his attributes;
so long as hope of escape held a place in
the remotest corner of his soul, he debated between
genuine repentance and its shadow. He
would yet make endeavors to release himself; if
successful his old ways would be avoided, and
humility might find a place in his mind, perhaps.
I was not thoroughly convinced that he had been
sufficiently overcome to warrant this favorable
conclusion; I was still anxious to put my hand on
him: he might forget his lesson. Being myself
unsettled, I experienced no trouble in attributing
all the hallucination to the individual at the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
end of the line. One last, glorious endeavor, and
he was free. I lifted my hat in token of his
prowess, though I had not entirely pardoned his
original conceit. When I saw him again he had
safely ensconced himself between two rocks with
his nose courting the opposite bank. He seemed
very passive, with his tail at right angles with the
gentle current. I watched him some time, but he
did not move; he was prostrated, if ever fish was,
in abject humiliation, crushed, absolutely, to earth.</p>

<p>I resolved to say nothing of my adventure. The
Major would receive my story with an aggravating
smile, a smile that quietly throws out temptation
to anger and violence. Or Joshua might break
out with that song of his:</p>

<p class="pp1">
"Tell me the old, old story."<br />
</p>

<p>But I will intrust it to you, in confidence, you
understand. I am a very good judge and he
weighed four pounds, if he weighed an ounce.</p>

<p>I recrossed the riffle and sought Mr. Dide. I
found him within a few feet of where I had deposited
him. He had procured his umbrella during
my absence, and, with the patience commendable
in the bait fisherman, was waiting for a rise in six
inches of water. I watched him for a while and
wondered if he would make even a fisherman; he
possessed some of the gifts of the angler.</p>

<p>"I see you have that umbrella again, Mr. Dide."</p>

<p>"Aw, yes&mdash;it is so vewy waam, you know, in the
sun."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you caught anything?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, but I anticipate a vewy big one, by-and-by."</p>

<p>I went up to the pool with the drift, and casting
my hackle close under the old log, was fast in
a moment to the mate of the one I had secured
before breakfast. Pursuing my former tactics I
was soon by the side of our friend, who watched
me with interest and encouraged me with his
doubts of my ability to land the captive. When
I finally brought him out, released him from the
hook and rapped him on the head with a stone,
Mr. Dide declared he never could accomplish such
a feat.</p>

<p>"Why, my deah boy, he would smash my pole,
you know."</p>

<p>His modesty gave me some hope that ultimately
he would arrive at proficiency, barring the umbrella.</p>

<p>At noon the Major put in his appearance with
twelve trout and two white-fish; the string weighed
sixteen pounds.</p>

<p>"That is a splendid average," said the Major,
spreading the fish out upon the grass, to be the
more conveniently admired as individuals.</p>

<p>These white-fish were the first we had taken,
although they are quite plentiful in the stream,
and are sometimes an annoyance to those who are
seeking trout only. Why they should be a source
of vexation to any one is a mystery. The fish is
beautiful in contour, more slender than the trout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
has a delicate mouth, rises eagerly to the fly, and
its meat is delicious. Break a Brazil nut in two,
and the firm white kernel will remind you of the
meat of the white-fish when it has been properly
cooked. They are good fighters withal, though
they do not break the water when hooked as
readily as the trout. To my mind the complaints
have in them somewhat of affectation, unless one
is indulging solely in the science of angling.</p>

<p>The following morning the camp was not astir
until the sun came up over the hills and, shining
in our faces, dried the moisture on our beards.
The Major was the first to awake, and looking in
Joshua's direction, discovered that individual in
the enjoyment of his morning nap. He called to
him:</p>

<p>"I thought you were going for a deer, Mr. Miles.
You should have been up before daylight."</p>

<p>Joshua declared that such had been his intention,
but on reflection he thought, that as he
would have to wade the stream, he would not go.</p>

<p>"But there must be good hunting on this side,
Mr. Miles."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shouldn't wonder, but it looks better
over on that side; mebbe I'll go when the grass
dries off."</p>

<p>"If you had only mentioned your preference I
would have gone out and driven a deer into camp."</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Major, can't you give us a
rest? I was sleepy this morning, that's a fact."</p>

<p>Before day the next morning, the Major slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
out of his blankets, and with his Winchester
started off in the direction of the aspens on the
hills below and back from the camp. The sun
had fairly streaked the east with gold color, and I
lay watching the coming light, dozing a few moments
and then awakening to see the surroundings
put on more definite shapes, when I heard the report
of a rifle. Before the echo ceased its complainings
I was asleep again, dreaming that the
major had encountered a silver-tip, and, failing in
his first shot, had been compelled to take to a
tree. I saw the brute tearing away at the bark
and my friend embracing the trunk a dozen feet
from the ground. The comical side of the picture
was appealing to me when the vision suddenly
vanished. I had been aroused by my own laughter,
and I saw the Major looking down at me with
a broad smile on his face.</p>

<p>"You must have been indulging in a pleasant
dream, my boy. Come, it is time you were out of
bed. Mr. Miles, will you please put the saddle
and bridle of Mr. Dide's on one of your mares and
go with me? I have killed that deer."</p>

<p>The Major was wet to the waist. Joshua looked
at him dolefully and crawled out, inquiring for
the locality of the game. When the Major told
him it was not half a mile away and he had seen
fresh bear tracks, he accelerated his pace and
longed for another rifle.</p>

<p>We had noticed every morning fresh deer signs
along the margin of the river, and the Major had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
stationed himself in some willows but a little way
from the camp. Just after daybreak the buck,
which he brought in was on his way for a morning
tipple when the Major called him to a halt. The
animal turned in his tracks on feeling the bullet,
and the Major had followed for nearly half a mile,
when he found him dead.</p>

<p>Joshua reported elk signs upon his return, and
was enjoying a new fever from that cause; but he
never found any cartridges in the magazine when
the weapon was left in camp.</p>

<p>We had passed two weeks in our delightful retreat,
seeing no one except the inhabitants of the
neighboring ranch, who would visit us at intervals
for a supply of trout, which we always had for
them. In return they brought us such quantities
of rich milk that we became surfeited. The
weather had been superb, without a drop of rain,
and we had no use even for the fly to shelter us at
night. The Major wished for a shower to break
the monotony, but we did not get it.</p>

<p>We had wondered more than once during our
idle moments concerning the deacon and his
whereabouts. One evening when Mr. Dide and
myself were alone at the camp-fire, the Major and
Joshua having gone to the neighboring ranch, I
made bold to inquire of the gentleman touching
the ladies in whose company we had left our friend.
Mr. Dide answered:</p>

<p>"Miss Jennie is a cousin, I believe, of the Deacon,
as you call him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"But about the other lady, Mr. Dide?"</p>

<p>"Aw,&mdash;Miss Gwace!&mdash;she is a vewy chawming
young lady, as you say."</p>

<p>"You have known her some time?"</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;y-a-s."</p>

<p>Mr. Dide retired within himself, and I concluded,
if I would learn anything, I must come to
the point without indirection.</p>

<p>"She seems to be alone here; how does that
happen?"</p>

<p>"Most extwaawdinawy&mdash;she is a vewy independent
young lady and went away fwom home because
of some misapwehension with her welatives. They
pwoposed that she mahwy a gentleman who was
distasteful to her and she declined."</p>

<p>"I admire her for declining such an alliance."</p>

<p>"So do I, you know&mdash;by Jove&mdash;I do! My impwession
is that if the gentleman had known he
was distasteful, he would have withdwawn himself&mdash;I
know he would."</p>

<p>"You know the gentleman, then?"</p>

<p>"Aw, y-a-s. But it was too bad, you know, that
she should be compelled to abandon her home. I
have twied to pwevail on her to weconsidah and
weturn, but she won't, you know. I have it fwom
a weliable fwiend that she wan out of money heah
last wintah, and became a waitah, watha than
communicate with her welatives. She is a bwave
young lady; I wegwet she deemed it necessawy to
do so."</p>

<p>"What was her objection to the gentleman, Mr.
Dide?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"She said to her fathah that he was a simpleton,&mdash;the
gentleman, I mean. She was wight, no doubt,
but she is a vewy extwaawdinawy young lady, you
know; she's a student of Dawwin and Huxley and
those fellows, and the gentleman&mdash;aw&mdash;he is&mdash;aw&mdash;only
a gentleman, you know, with no taste in
that direction."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Dide, I believe you&mdash;he is a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I&mdash;I know him and he would not
have sanctioned it&mdash;weally&mdash;he would have ceased
his attentions at once. It is a vewy unhappy situation&mdash;he
was not advised until she had put her
wesolution into effect. She is a vewy amiable
young lady, but she has too much pwide to seek a
wecconciliation with her pawents. I endeavahed
to pwesent the mattah to her in the stwongest
light, but she would not be moved."</p>

<p>"She seemed to be very favorably impressed with
the Deacon, Mr. Dide," I ventured to insinuate.</p>

<p>"Aw, y-a-s, you are wight; the Deacon is, I
think, a vewy estimable gentleman."</p>

<p>"But suppose he should not be serious, Mr.
Dide&mdash;the Deacon is a stranger to you, and he
might be trifling."</p>

<p>"Twifling! impossible! I cannot think so of
him."</p>

<p>"Ah! Deacon! Deacon!" I thought, "you called
this gentleman, contemptuously, 'a dude'&mdash;how
do you compare with him?" and confessed to
myself that the verdict was not in favor of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
friend. I had no question of the Deacon's integrity.
I was looking only for one of the elements
that go to make up a gentleman, and found
that Mr. Dide was better endowed with unselfishness.</p>

<p>The Major and Joshua coming in, the subject
between Mr. Dide and myself was dropped. That
night when my friend and I were covered with
our blankets, looking out at the bright lamps and
ready to be wooed into unconsciousness by the
river's melody, he said to me:</p>

<p>"I have changed my mind concerning our new
friend. I thought he would be a bore, at least, but
I have discovered him to be a gentleman."</p>

<p>"So have I." But I did not deem it necessary
to explain to him why I had reached the same
conclusion.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="p1 pn center mid">SUCCESS AND&mdash;SUCCESS.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Breaking camp, we went down the river as far
as Still Water. I left our old quarters with a feeling
of regret, thinking that when I came again I
should find them occupied; it was like giving up
to strangers a home where life has been sweet.
No one may question the stranger's right nor his
good taste, but it is not a pleasant reflection that
in due course one will be crowded out or will drop
from his place, and the world will move round at
the same old rate, as if one had never encumbered
the earth; the thought tends to induce humility.</p>

<p>"It's like stickin' your finger in a pail of water,
then pullin' it out and lookin' for the hole," said
Joshua, as I expressed my regrets.</p>

<p>"I have heard that comparison before, Mr.
Miles."</p>

<p>"So have I, Major. Mebbe I'll strike somethin'
yet that you <i>ain't</i> heard."</p>

<p>The retort called a smile to the Major's face as
he turned away.</p>

<p>The camp for a day on the Still Water gave the
Major an opportunity to shoot a few ducks, and
the variety of our larder was thus added to. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
found my way through the willows and reached a
clear place on the bank. The pool thus exposed
to me presented an abundance of fish, the water
being perfectly clear and glassy on the surface. I
cast into it and the inhabitants started in every
direction away from the lure. It was a good place
to practice delicacy, and I soon concluded that
delicacy was not among my talents. Now and
then I would deliver the fly in a way that caused
no commotion; the trout would not look at it, and
as I drew it across the water, they would come up
gently and take something within a few feet of it,
then settle back, leaving a little ripple on the surface
to widen. I changed flies several times, but
the result was still the same: neither variety nor
size seemed of any avail, yet the trout were feeding.
I put a shot on the leader, threw above, and
drawing the fly down, allowed it to sink and
moved it slowly among them. One fellow came
forward a little and looked at it, and I became
satisfied that I saw him turn up his nose in disgust.
That a human being of ordinary intelligence,
as he presumed me to be, should put such
an abominable species of diet as a bedraggled
coachman on his dining-table, was beyond laughing
at or praying for,&mdash;words were too feeble to
express his scorn&mdash;he could only turn up his nose
and move away. The verdict was as clear to me
as the water.</p>

<p>A grasshopper might decoy one of those fellows
to destruction, but there could be no credit in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
to me, as an angler. It would be assuming the
rôle of a Borgia and not taking an adversary with
all his faculties alert&mdash;it would be secret poisoning
and not the clean rapier glittering in the sunlight
backed by a heart willing to take equal chances.
I scorned the grasshopper in this emergency, as
the beautiful denizen of the crystal scorned my
ragged servitor.</p>

<p>Close to the bank I saw a white-fish moving
slowly up stream, nosing the small rocks as if he
might be in search of a tid-bit to tickle a fastidious
palate. His small scales were distinct, and with
the sun's rays playing upon them he was the perfection
of beauty in color. His dainty mouth was
fairly visible, turned up to me, and his gill-covers
glistened like polished silver. I took the shot
from the leader and dropped the fly upon the surface
about a yard in front of him, barely moving
it. The water was about four feet deep and he
was near the bottom. When he caught sight of
the fraud, it seemed to me that I saw his eyes
suddenly distend; the iris became animated and
shone within a flexible circle of pale gold, as he
sculled quickly to the surface and closed upon the
hook. At the critical moment I gave the fatal
motion of the wrist and the trim quarry was fast.
The instant he felt the sting he darted, like a
flash of light through a clear topaz, for the bottom
and centre of the pool. His flight was a strong,
steady pull, always below the surface. I would
draw him up, but the moment his nostrils tasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the air, he would strive for the depths. Believing
him too heavy to lift out, and the bank being too
high and abrupt for me to get down to him, I
permitted him to fight until he was too feeble to
prevent my holding his head clear from the water.
In this condition, and when I deemed a violent
struggle among the possibilities merely, I drew
him toward the bank, kneeled, and taking the
leader in my left hand as low as I could reach, I
swung him upon the grass; he came straight,
without the slightest movement until he touched
the ground, otherwise he would have been free.
I could not but notice how firm his body felt, as I
grasped him to take out the hook; there was no
yielding whatever to the pressure of my hand; he
might have been absolutely as solid as a stone.
Then I thought of those who take it upon themselves
to talk flippantly of these pieces of perfection
in their way, and felt a sympathy for the
grumblers in their weakness.</p>

<p>I placed the fish in the shade of the willows and
lengthened the line again; I felt encouraged by
my success and thought I might secure a trout.
They had returned to their several stations, after
a short respite from the recent commotion, but
all that I could see, scattered as I threw them the
fly, save one; he seemed indifferent and remained
at his post. I cast in his vicinity several times;
he finally seemed inclined to move, and I coaxed
him, as I thought, though perhaps I may have incited
him to anger and a determination to drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
my monstrosity away. Whether rage, sudden
hunger or curiosity impelled him was a matter of
indifference to me; suffice it to say that he
abruptly darted up and took the hitherto scouted
mystery, and I fastened it directly through his
tongue. My movement and his own impetus
brought him clear of the water; he went back with
a plunge, was up again in a few moments, shaking
himself in a very paroxysm of rage and terror.
Half a dozen times he rushed hither and yon, but
at all times he felt the spring of the splendid toy
in my hand. If he moved to the opposite shore,
it checked his career and responded to his every
motion, as he circled back. A straight shoot directly
up stream, or down, the bamboo arched over
him like the wand of fate. He would pause at
times as if by contemplation he might solve the
occult cause of his restraint, and thus devise an
avenue of escape, but his destiny was determined.
A few more struggles and he surrendered. He
could not release himself; I could not free him, or
I verily believe I should have bowed deferentially
and requested him to retain his sword.</p>

<p>Even when he was so far exhausted that I could
draw him toward me without resistance, I dared
not attempt to lift him out as I had his predecessor.
I called the Major and he came to me, held
on by the willows, and slipping down the bank
seized and threw the gallant champion upon the
sod. It seemed like indignity to him to have him
thus handled, and I told the Major so. He should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
have been lifted out with the net and received
with a delicacy commensurate with his greatness.</p>

<p>The white-fish weighed one pound and a half,
the trout one pound and a quarter. Caught within
fifteen minutes of each other, it was a fit time to
determine their qualities as warriors. The trout,
of course, from the dash and brilliancy of his
evolutions, must bear the palm, but the sturdy determination
of his neighbor in the pool must have
a share of praise. I love them both, with a little
more admiration in my heart for the black-spotted
denizen.</p>

<p>The time to fish this water when a full creel is
desired quickly is when there is a slight breeze,
just sufficient force in the summer air to caress
the surface into a gentle ripple. I warrant me,
then there will be leaping and sport that will be
fast and glorious. I had read of a trick, and tried
it. I found a cottonwood leaf for my purpose,
and wetting it, that the fly might stick to it gently,
threw it into the pool. After several trials I succeeded
in getting the fly partly upon it with sufficient
hold at least to guide the leaf, which I
worked down to where the trout seemed more
numerous. I gave the fly a gentle flirt and it fell
from the novel argosy into the water; it had not
floated a foot before it was seized, and I had another
fight on my hands, much to the interest and
amusement of the Major.</p>

<p>At noon Mr. Dide expressed a preference for
our late camp over the present one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot heah the wipple of the watah, you
know," was his explanation.</p>

<p>"Then, Mr. Dide, we will move on, and make
camp below the Still Water, for a few days," said
the major, expressing my wishes as well. "I have
a weakness for that music, myself," he continued;
"as cowering upon the lofty cliff, I trembling
court the wondrous depths; with eager eyes I seek
the angry rush and the flashing tints of foaming
waves. Borne high upon the ambient air, the solemn
whispers of troubled souls and the rippling
laughter of the blest reach past me, intertwined,
to sink again in lamentation. Then, lying prone,
my attentive ears drink in the softer sighs of the
sweeping crystal, and stills all my pulse to catch
the cadence of the liquid rhythm, sweet as the
fading notes of some dear vesper hymn, lingering
in hushed cathedral aisles."</p>

<p>"Bwavo! bwavo! my deah Majah! you have
won my heart!" exclaimed Mr. Dide, clapping his
hands, and ecstatic enthusiasm apparently exuding
from his entire person. My amazement kept me
silent. That the Major should indulge in "that
sort of sky-scraping," as Joshua irreverently expressed
it, rather weakened my friend in our <i>chef's</i>
estimation for the time. The Major received
Joshua's strictures in dignified silence, which
made the latter think there was more in the
Major's poetic escapade than mere words, and, like
every other mystery to the average intellect, it
became weighty; he requested the Major to write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
it down, and that is how it found a place here; I
purloined the manuscript.</p>

<p>We moved down after the noonday meal and
made camp in a secluded spot not a great way
from the forks of the river.</p>

<p>That evening, when our fire burned low, Joshua
felt in the mood to sing. Having concluded one
hymn he struck into another familiar to Mr.
Dide. The effusion had a refrain of some sort,
and we were all startled by hearing that taken up
and repeated by female voices. Not being superstitious,
the Major moved out of the light of our
own fire and discovered the reflection of another
some little distance away. We had, in the vicinity,
mortals like ourselves, but fairer, no doubt, and
Joshua, with Mr. Dide's help, sent out frequent
invitations to the unknown singers, bringing a response
until the hour grew late. The episode was
not an unpleasant one, and I thought it might
pave the way to an acquaintance with our neighbors.
In the morning I started on a prospecting
tour, and the first individual I met proved, much
to my surprise, to be the Deacon, whom I discovered
gathering wood with which to cook breakfast.</p>

<p>Where did he come from?</p>

<p>"Why, Trapper's Lake&mdash;we came down the
river yesterday, with the intention of spending a
week on the South Fork, hoping to find you and
the Major. I had no notion you two were the
singers, or I should have called last night."</p>

<p>"Then you have the ladies with you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, my cousin and her mother,&mdash;you saw
my cousin at Cascade,&mdash;they were the singers you
heard answering you."</p>

<p>"The Major and I were not the singers,
Deacon."</p>

<p>"No? well, who is camped over there by you?"</p>

<p>"Our cook and Mr. Dide were the singers you
heard."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dide&mdash;oh, he's with you, is he?" and there
came a smile into the Deacon's face, as he repeated
the name, that, with his tone, indicated nothing
to be apprehended by the speaker from the
vicinity or presence of Mr. Dide, and in addition,
his air was patronizing. Had I not known the
Deacon well, having much faith in his kindness of
heart, his manner in speaking of my newer friend
would have proved offensive.</p>

<p>"If you are so fortified in your own mind,
Deacon, you can afford to speak less cavalierly of
Mr. Dide."</p>

<p>"Fortified?" he repeated, "how fortified? Don't
talk in riddles, old boy."</p>

<p>"You understand, well enough&mdash;victory should
make you courteous to the conquered."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear sir, I never treated him uncivilly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but you spoke uncivilly of him&mdash;you
called him a dude, and your manner, just
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, is he not a dude?"</p>

<p>"He is every inch a gentleman, Deacon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"I may not dispute that; but you seem to take
great interest in him."</p>

<p>"Not without reason, Deacon. What became of
Miss Grace?"</p>

<p>"Miss Grace&mdash;why, she's in camp there, with my
aunt and cousin." The Deacon's face was wreathed
in a smile unmistakable in its import.</p>

<p>"I'm not disposed to be impertinent, Deacon&mdash;but
are you engaged to Miss Grace?"</p>

<p>"Engaged! why, my dear sir, we were married
ten days ago, at Glenwood."</p>

<p>"The d&mdash;deuce you were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fact, my dear old boy&mdash;and she's the sweetest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spare us, Deacon! you seem to have been expeditious."</p>

<p>"Not so,&mdash;I have known her for a year, nearly;
we were engaged last winter. Cousin Jennie and
she were schoolmates east."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the way of it. Do you know that
Mr. Dide will be glad to congratulate you?"</p>

<p>"No, I <i>don't</i> know it&mdash;to tell you frankly, he
was the cause of her leaving home; perhaps I
ought to feel friendly toward him because of that&mdash;indirectly
he became my benefactor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, Deacon, let me tell you something,"
and I detailed the conversation I had held
with Mr. Dide over the camp-fire. "Now, you
see, if he had been aware of her wishes she would
have had no excuse for leaving; she did not refuse
him directly, and her bear of a father had set his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
mind in one direction and thought, no doubt, he
was taking in the horizon, when he was only in a
small hole of his own digging. Mr. Dide explained
this to your wife, at Cascade, where they
accidentally met, and she has failed to tell it to
you. You know now how unselfish he was and is.
Could you have relinquished your object with the
same degree of nobleness?"</p>

<p>"Not one in a thousand would. But I don't just
like the idea of some other man loving my wife
better than I do."</p>

<p>"So long as she does not love him in return,
you can have no cause of complaint."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right. I'll take in this wood
and call on Mr. Dide."</p>

<p>Our friend received the announcement from me
very quietly and greeted the Deacon cordially on
his arrival. When the latter went away, Mr. Dide
sauntered off to the river bearing his rod and umbrella.
We saw nothing of him at noon, and later
on I concluded to hunt him up. I had not gone
far when I discovered him seated on the edge of a
pool. He had one trout, thoroughly dried, and
was waiting for another rise; the fly had floated
down and lodged against a bit of willow that hung
to the bank by its roots, while the limbs vibrated
with the current. He started when I spoke to
him, but looked up cheerfully, saying:</p>

<p>"I am afwaid I shall not make a success at
fishing."</p>

<p>"Not if you sit still, Mr. Dide; you should keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
moving and the fly must not be allowed to rest a
moment."</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;that makes one's ahms ache, you know."</p>

<p>It might have made his heart ache less, perhaps.</p>

<p>"Supper is about ready&mdash;won't you come in to
camp?"</p>

<p>"Weally, I did not think it was so late&mdash;thanks."</p>

<p>In the evening Mr. Dide announced that he
should go to Meeker on the following day, and
thence he knew not where, definitely.</p>

<p>"You'll go to Glenwood, won't you? I'd like
to have you take word to my folks and tell 'em
how we're gettin' on," Joshua requested, on Mr.
Dide's stating his determination to return to civilization.
The gentleman consented in his usual
affable way. At the earliest opportunity, I informed
Mr. Dide who Joshua's "folks" were.</p>

<p>"Weally! that vewy extwaadinawy old lady! I
shall be obliged to wequest him to wite&mdash;then I
can dwop it in the mail, you know."</p>

<p>And so on the morrow Mr. Dide drifted out of
sight.</p>

<p class="p1 pn center mid">VAPOR.</p>

<p class="pn p2">At the next evening's camp-fire I took down
the Deacon's report of his trip:</p>

<p>"The trail from Glenwood Springs to Trapper's
Lake is good, and the country through which it
runs is always attractive, beautiful, and in places
grand. In fact, it is a difficult matter, you know,
to go astray of magnificent scenery in these beloved
mountains of ours. We made one camp, the
ladies being out for pleasure and not in a hurry,
and for one day's ride the trip is a little tiresome,
especially if you are not accustomed to the saddle.
Our camp outfit and provisions made light loads
for two pack animals.</p>

<p>"The first view of the lake coming in from
the south side is finer than that from the trail out
of Egeria Park. By the latter route you come
directly upon the lake from the timber, low down
the mountain side, and look directly across. By
the way we came you get a fine view of the lake
first from a point higher up the mountain, and
can look down upon it, along its length, toward
the outlet. You have a foreground of the beautiful
lake, and through the wide gap at its foot a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
distant range of hills veiled in the gray mist forms
a background, while the lake itself, except at the
outlet, is shut in by the high-terraced mountains.
These mountains, you will remember, reach down
to the very margin of the lake, excepting only at
the little meadow on the left of the outlet. The
terraces are thickly covered with pines until the
last precipice is reached, which runs up above the
timber line.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-144.jpg" width="400" height="241"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Trapper's Lake.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">"We remained four days there, fishing from rafts.
There are two varieties of trout in the lake, the
light and the salmon-colored. The light variety
are the fighters, of course, and so abundant that
but for the presence of others to help us dispose
of them they would spoil on our hands; they are
large, too, running uniformly to fourteen inches
in length.</p>

<p>"I killed a buck in the little meadow near the
outlet. The Deaconess declares that those four
days were 'just too lovely.'"</p>

<p>"But about the trail, Deacon, from the lake to
the forks here?"</p>

<p>"It is a good trail. Did you ever see an Indian
trail that wasn't good? Our red brother, as you
call him, is a first-class engineer in that respect;
he is the only one who accomplishes his purpose
prompted by pure laziness. We took the ridge
part of the way, and made a short <i>détour</i> to see
the Devil's Causeway, and on that account saw a
band of elk; there were fifty in the band at least,
because I counted that number, and missed some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
without doubt. There was indeed a commotion
in the camp when I announced the discovery of
bear signs, but I succeeded in allaying the fright
by persuading them to believe that Cuffy was no
more liable to attack us than the deer were. We
had splendid fishing in the Pot Hole Valley, and
I want you to know that I landed a trout of five
pounds and four ounces out of one of those pools,
and that's no fish story. The trout run large as
they do here in the South Fork. White-fish are
plentiful, too; the largest one I caught weighed a
scant two pounds, and I know you agree with me
as to their excellence on the table. The valley is
filling up, though, with settlers; it is not so much
in the wilderness as it was a few years ago."</p>

<p>"You are having an unusual wedding tour,
Deacon."</p>

<p>"But a very happy one. Just try it, and see
for yourself."</p>

<p>"I have been travelling the 'long path' too
many years for that, Deacon."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll enjoy it, all the same."</p>

<p>Of course I had to thank the Deacon for the
compliment and I promised to "try it."</p>

<p>The next day a few fleecy clouds climbed up
over the hills in the west, and in the afternoon
we moved further down the river toward Meeker.
That evening we put up the fly for the first time,
lapped and pegged down the ends. We thought
we might have rain before morning, but were
disappointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>The following morning the clouds put in an
appearance again; the sky had been absolutely
clear during the most of our trip, and the pretty
harbingers afforded a relief. From white they
gathered into clusters and turned to gray, and the
drapery of a darker shade, hanging below, told of
the rain. It passed us by, however, and we had a
beautiful sunset. The west was clear, while just
above a range of hills in the east, veiled with a
thin blue mist, was a stratum of pale bronze, its
upper line apparently as straight as if run by a
level. From this base of miles in length there
arose a great mass of clouds, seemingly thousands
of feet in height, and white as carded wool. Its
northern and southern ends were almost perpendicular,
and its summit of great rolling folds was
outlined against the delicate blue of the sky. For
half an hour there seemed no change; the huge
pile stood apparently still, pure and white as
newly-fallen snow. Then, as if moved by some
gentle and artistic freak of its presiding genius, a
rift in a mountain side appeared, reaching from
the bronze base to the top, the line was sharply
defined in white and gray and the shadow was
cast against the background of white to our right.
Away at the northerly summit a small bit seemed
to break away, or was left; it divided, and in a
few moments there were clearly defined a pair of
gigantic wings, regular in their contour as those
of a bird. In another place a gray tower presented
itself with a great arched doorway near its base.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Castles would spring into a brief existence, machicolated
and loop-holed, to be lost again in some
modern cottage with vine-clad porch. Along the
upper margin figures would come and go as if the
gods and their retinues were all abroad directing a
magnificent display. And in one corner, by itself,
there was plainly outlined a fleecy hood, into
which I caught myself intently gazing, expecting
to see the laughing eyes and face of a beautiful
child. All this in tones of white and gray. But
as the sun sank lower, veils of slanting mist appeared
here and there, the apparently solid mass
was being broken up, the summit was still white
scroll-work, but below, the line of bronze had
turned into a crimson shade, within an uneven
apex; the lead-colored base of the main body was
changing to a purple hue, and all through the
mass the rose and amber were being laid in, shifting
from moment to moment, until the hues became
bewildering in their multitude; then, as the
sun went down, the gray tones returned again,
such as the artist may sometimes give a hint of
but never paints.</p>

<p>It was a great storm we had witnessed, away
over the range to the east; we were far from the
sound of the artillery, and it hid from us the
flash of its batteries.</p>

<p>During the beautiful display the Deacon's young
wife sat a few feet in front of me and to the left.
She had moved but once, and that was when the
first shadow came and marked out the great gorge;
she turned round then, and said to me:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it not grand?"</p>

<p>When the rose tints faded out, she turned again;
there was a mist in her dark eyes, and a perceptible
quiver about her pretty lips; she spoke in a
half-whisper, as of one just awakened from a happy
vision:</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anything so glorious? and
yet I felt all the time as if I must kneel and look
upon it with reverence."</p>

<p>I did not blame Mr. Dide, nor the Deacon; they
couldn't help it; I envied her father.</p>

<p>"When we can have our backs to the afternoon
sun, with a mountain range to the east of us, these
magnificent carnivals of shadows are not uncommon."</p>

<p>"Did you see the baby's bonnet? was it not too
cute for anything?" and then, half-musingly to
me, "you have lived in these beautiful mountains
since before the time I was born&mdash;you ought to
be happy!"</p>

<p>I told her that happiness was my normal condition,
and then she wanted to know of me if I had
ever read Ruskin, and I said I hadn't.</p>

<p>"I wish he could have seen what we have this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"He would have criticised and found fault
with it."</p>

<p>"It is unkind of you to say so, knowing nothing
of him."</p>

<p>The rebuke was quick, earnest, and, I confessed
to myself, not wholly unwarranted. I determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
to read Ruskin, and I presume that if the Major
and the others had not just then drifted up to us,
I should have been led off after "Darwin and
those fellows." With such disciples the philosophers
in question might effect a revolution rapidly.</p>

<p>The Major and the others, except Joshua, had
much to say about the afternoon's entertainment.
Joshua didn't see anything except a great bank of
clouds, and knew there had been a storm on the
main range.</p>

<p>While we were at supper (and since we had
ladies in company, the Major had improvised a
table out of some boards which he picked up,
using the wagon seats for supports), our table now
decked with wild flowers, and the tin plates and
cups presenting a brighter appearance, we had a
call. Our visitor was a lank mortal in flannel
shirt, blue cotton overalls, and the ordinary white
felt hat of the country. He was not a cowboy,
but "a hand" from a neighboring ranch, who had
"hoofed it in last fall."</p>

<p>"Evenin'," was his salutation, with a nod, intended
for all of us. "Bin campin' out, ain't ye?
Had a good time, s'pose&mdash;lots o' fish and sech?
Didn't see nothin' of a roan cayuse with a strip
in face, up crick? No! been a-huntin' the darn
brute since noon-time; branded 'J. K.' on his left
hip."</p>

<p>"You'd better keep on, if you count on findin'
him before night," hinted Joshua, shaking a flapjack
in the frying-pan preparatory to a final turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stranger in these parts?" the visitor inquired
of Joshua.</p>

<p>"Yes; been here a week."</p>

<p>"More'n that&mdash;I see you go up crick more'n two
weeks ago. What's yer business?"</p>

<p>"Mindin' it."</p>

<p>"Mindin' what?"</p>

<p>"My business."</p>

<p>"Don't know as you'll ever die o' brain fever."</p>

<p>"Neither will you, if you stay in this country.
I wonder you wasn't buried before spring."</p>

<p>"They wasn't no fellers round here handy
'nough&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What can we do for you, my friend?" broke
in the Major, in some doubt as to the result of the
dialogue.</p>

<p>"Nothin', 'bleeged to ye, 'less yer got sumpin's
good for cuts; cut my finger sharpnin' a sickle;
durn near cut it off an' it's festerin'&mdash;see." He
exposed the wounded member. If there is anything
in life with a tendency to raise one's curiosity,
or anything else, I know of nothing more
potent than a sick finger at meal time. The
stranger was generously determined that none of
us should miss the luxury. The Major stared,
the ladies turned away, and Joshua, out of all patience,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Come off the shelf, man, the flies'll eat you up."</p>

<p>The stranger's attention was distracted.</p>

<p>"Whatcher mean? I ain't got no flies on me,
mister."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cover up that paw o' yours and go after your
cayuse&mdash;don't you see it up yonder in the willers?"
And Joshua took our visitor by the arm and
started him in the right direction. He led him
farther than was necessary, the pony being in
sight, and they had some conversation on the
way, but we did not overhear it, and they seemed
to part with a satisfactory understanding.</p>

<p>The next day we made a move still farther down
stream and camped in the vicinity of the site selected
by the government for the erection of a sawmill
that was to aid in civilizing the Utes. The
habitations that had been erected at great expense
were no longer visible; literally not one stone remained
upon another. The boiler was perforated
with bullet-holes, and rusty bits of machinery lay
scattered over a square mile of the level mesa. A
more complete wreck than this, effected by the
gentle savages, would be hard to conceive, and a
more sorrowful exhibition of sheer viciousness
could not have been expressed; it was as if the
destroyers had determined to obliterate every vestige
that might give rise even to a memory of the
kindness intended them. Those beautiful symbols
of peace, the doves, were plentiful, flitting about
the ruins, as docile as if the valley had never
known a wrathful moment. The birds were not
within the protection of the law, but to kill them
in such a place seemed like adding sacrilege to
cruelty, so not one was harmed.</p>

<p>Upon the breaking up of this camp our company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
was to be divided. The Deacon and his relatives
would turn off to the right a few miles below, to
visit the Thornburg battle-ground, while the Major
and I would take our way back over the old route
to Glenwood Springs. One more day's sojourn on
the beautiful river at our first camping-ground,
below Meeker, and we bade farewell, reluctantly,
to the charming valley. But the keen edge of
our unwillingness was softened by an assurance to
ourselves that another summer would find us again
with our tent pitched amid the sweet peacefulness.
We would come again, if for no other purpose, to
make acquaintance with the trail to Trapper's
Lake&mdash;the gem of the Roan Range.</p>

<p>There is no comfort whatever in towels, with a
tin cup for a bath-tub; the White River is no place
to bathe in, unless one would encourage pneumonia
or the rheumatism. The sight of the great pool
at Glenwood, after several weeks of travesty, gave
a hint of marvellous luxury. It was as if we approached
the performance of a religious rite; we
stood upon the edge, filled with the eagerness of
neophytes, but hesitating for a moment before
penetrating the mystery whose revelation we
sought. But once within the warm embrace of
the voluptuous crystal, the Wesleyan admonition
was made manifest; we washed, and worshipped
close to the throne. Then we thanked the men
whose enterprise had converted the possibility of
the luxury into a fact.</p>

<p>"Epicurean Rome could boast of no such treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
as this," exclaimed the Major, shaking the crystal
drops from his shaggy mane, as he rose to the surface
after the first plunge.</p>

<p>"I don't know much about Rome," said Joshua,
"but this suits me, this does."</p>

<p>We left the bright little city beautifully nestled
among the carmine hills, as the afternoon sun was
caressing the summits of the mountains in the
west. We were again on the rail, speeding up the
valley of the Roaring Fork. A slight bend in
the road and Mount Sopris towers grandly, in
front and to the right of us, with its long patch
of snow offering a perpetual challenge to our daily
friend.</p>

<p>The ride up the great gorge in the western slope
to the top of the Saguache Range affords a grander
pageant than that in descending. One experiences
a sensation of quiet, while one is looking
down upon a panorama that is drifting. As the
sun touches only the highest peaks the magnificent
cliffs and wooded mountain sides are in shadow,
seem animate, and as if stealing away, phantom-like,
into the deepening twilight below. But the
sunlight of the morrow will clothe the scene in
new beauties, and the summer days to come will be
bountiful in fresh surprises for the sojourner in
these recesses of the majestic hills.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="p1 pn center mid">PIKE'S PEAK.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The name has a familiar sound; I have heard
it almost every day for nearly three decades, and
wherever English is spoken the name has been
mentioned. Having it in sight daily, with its
long slope reaching up to the apex over fourteen
thousand feet high, its north face always clothed
in or fretted with snow, it might seem that it
would grow monotonous. Monotony is not possible
with the magnificent eminence and, like the
presence of one we love, it is always welcome. The
great ice-field at the pole is as to the earth but
the thickness of a hair, the great mountain range
as a wrinkle on the surface; but we measure the
thickness and the heights by miles. They who
made the Bible possible loved the high places of
the earth; the law was there given to the great
leader, and the beloved Master sought the mountain
top to pray. It lifted him away from the
earth while he was of it, but brought him nearer
to the Father. It is the vantage ground of humility,
the sanctuary where arrogance cannot enter.</p>

<p>The devil was lacking in tact when he offered
the world to the Master from a mountain top; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
royal highness was out of his element, the atmosphere
was repugnant. Neither he nor his pupils
lack ambition, but on a mountain top there is
nothing to which mortal may aspire, except the
unknowable, and for the unknowable he is made
willing to bide his time in meekness. It is no
place for his majesty to proselyte; his most zealous
disciples even, are liable to step into the path
he never designed for them. No doubt the devil
would have failed, on the occasion in question,
had he selected a valley where the air was impure,
but to seek a mountain top as the theatre for the
bribery of One purer than the element he breathed,
only goes to show that the devil, with all his accredited
intelligence, was a very great ass. The
only mystery to me is that he himself was not
then and there led captive and future generations
saved from his machinations. The solution may
be that, being already condemned, he was beyond
the pale of divine influence. I would, however
give the devil his due, and should be glad to surmise
that he longed to be clean, but was so much
of a dolt as not to be worth regenerating.</p>

<p>The first man to climb a mountain peak may
be pardoned exultation at the accomplishment of
his feat. The gallant officer whose name this
mountain bears essayed that exploit and failed,
though history says he wrought valiantly. Grand
monuments are not infrequently erected to the
undeserving. We have other mountains with
titles a little more satirical; there can be no objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
to commemorating the memory of a dead
hero, for a man is rarely a hero until he is dead,
and this is no paradox. But except in a very few
instances, it were well to leave the erection of
memorials to the intimate friends of the dear departed,
rather than to appropriate, without permission,
the works of the Almighty. Mountains,
however, are abundant, and we, not being the
owners, can afford to give them away; it were
better, though, to reward our live friends out of
our own earnings. We know in such case they
would have the chance at least to appreciate our
acknowledgment of their merits.</p>

<p>He who goes up a mountain by trail may exult
in a lesser degree than the first explorer. But all
may not surmount unexplored mountains; many
cannot do so even by trail. To him, then, who
makes the happiness of conversion from the ills
of this life possible to all, if only for an hour,
great credit is due, and he may, with an easy conscience
no doubt, exact toll for his achievement.</p>

<p>To the æsthetic it may seem like a sacrilege to
disfigure a great mountain with a road; but a road
for human needs is so slight a scratch here on the
earth's surface that it does not mar the surroundings.
The good that it does outweighs the apparent
desecration. As the Major and myself aspire
to that which is high, and as neither of us might
reach the summit of the peak by the primitive
methods any more than office may now be so
reached, the opportunity to gratify our ambition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
by carriage was a blessing. The novelty must be
considered as adding to the zest.</p>

<p>The mountain is not visible from Cascade, the
initial point of the road; the intervening hills shut
it out. Starting thence we follow the Fountain
up a very little distance, then turn to the left
along the face of the first hill, then to the right,
and so winding our way for two miles we reach
the vicinity of the Grotto in Cascade Cañon. In
a direct line we are half a mile from the starting-point.
Over and through the pines that sparsely
cover the mountain side, and over beds of wild
flowers that carpet the slope, we can, before this
distance is accomplished, obtain a fair view of the
valley of the Fountain, Cascade and Manitou,
thence out on to the broad plains, rising blue and
dim until they kiss the horizon. One does not
look for valleys in the mountain tops, but a mountain
top reached is still further surmounted, and
the road winds through aspen glades and the air
is freighted with the odor of pines.</p>

<p>The four horses trundle the light Beach wagon
along most of the way at a trot. The driver tells
you that after a little while the horses must be
brought down to a walk. The grade is not steep,
but "in the light air a fast gait would be a little
hard on the stock."</p>

<p>Eight and a half miles we have come in a little
less than two hours. "A pretty good road," that
allows the making of such time to an elevation of
over three thousand feet, at a guess. We are half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
way and are still in the timber. "The horses are
changed to mules here"&mdash;an extraordinary metamorphosis,
certainly&mdash;that is the way the driver
put it, but there was no mystery in his language,
except to a Boston lady, who was anxious to witness
the process. Verily one must speak by the
card in such a presence, or "equivocation will
undo us." The four mules seemed to consider
their load a trifle and they moved as jauntily as if
out for a holiday.</p>

<p>To beguile the tediousness of the way we were
assured that on returning we should "come in a
whirl." The motive that prompted the information
was commendable, and the driver to be excused&mdash;he
travelled the road every day and his
early pleasure had simply turned into an attractive
matter of business. We told him not to hurry
on our account, as it was our desire to miss no
part of the scenery. He said he should come back
in two hours and a half. I had ridden behind
mules before&mdash;I mean in period of time&mdash;and was
doubtful touching the prospective gloriousness of
the journey, but he assured me that it was perfectly
safe. He spoke of a "switch-back," and
there was an intimation of occult peril in his
manner. When we reached the vicinity of the
timber line he pointed out the mystery. From
our point of vision the zigzag scratches away up
on the steep mountain side reminded me of old
times. I was having a longitudinal view of a few
sections of worm fence running up a hill at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
angle of seventy degrees; at least a man under the
influence of spirits would say it was a longitudinal
view. Considered as a fence, from an economical
basis, the angles were unnecessarily acute; it might
fairly have represented five miles of fence and half
a mile of ground in a straight line, or it looked as
if unknown powers at each end were trying to
jam the thing together and make it double up on
itself.</p>

<p>I was very much interested in it. As a line for
an irrigating ditch it might be pronounced a success.
As nothing goes down a ditch except water,
and very little of that in a dry season, nobody is
put in jeopardy.</p>

<p>"And you come down there at the rate of eight
or nine miles an hour?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes, easy enough."</p>

<p>"I should think it would be easy, especially if
you went off one of those corners."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't know the difference."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not. It must be a glorious ride,
coming down at the rate of eight or nine miles an
hour, I think you said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, eight or nine, mebbe less, dependin'."</p>

<p>"You can make it in less time, then?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"And turn round those corners?"</p>

<p>"'Course, how else? You don't s'pose I'm
thinkin' 'bout rollin' down the mountain side?"</p>

<p>I wondered what else it would be without snow
on the ground; but the driver seemed a little too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
short of breath to answer. I accounted for his
deficiency in this regard because of the altitude;
we were above timber line, eleven thousand feet
and over from sea-level. The pines had become
dwarfed, naked on one side, and were leaning
toward the rocks above them, or, in their sturdy
struggle for existence, they clung to the precipitous
mountain side like matted vines. Looking down
from a certain point I observed a large quantity
of the road resembling a corpulent angle-worm in
several stages of colic. I could not resist appealing
to the driver again; I don't think anybody
could.</p>

<p>"Do you go round all those places at the rate
of eight or nine miles an hour?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"And you don't slow up?"</p>

<p>"What should I slow up for?"</p>

<p>"So as not to turn over, you know."</p>

<p>"I never turned over in my life, and I drove
stage in California twenty years."</p>

<p>I believed he was a liar, but deemed it inexpedient
to tell him so, although he was a small man.</p>

<p>"Never had a runaway either, I suppose?" and
sitting behind him I casually&mdash;it being convenient&mdash;put
my hand on his biceps; the arm was not
large, but assuring.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>My opinion of his veracity was not augmented.</p>

<p>"I hardly think you can make the time you say
you can."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just wait and see."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it will be grand; I've been suffering
for such an experience."</p>

<p>"I didn't know but you was gittin' a little nervous&mdash;they
sometimes do."</p>

<p>"Nervous! I'm an old stager. I have ridden
with Bill Updyke and Jake Hawks many a mile
in these mountains. Take it in the winter time,
down hill, for instance, the road covered with ice
and the driver obliged to whip his horses into a
dead run to keep the coach from sliding and
swinging off such a place as that," and I pointed
to a precipice several hundred feet perpendicular
at our left. "That's coaching!" and I placed my
hand upon his shoulder affectionately. During
the colloquy the Major had not opened his lips.</p>

<p>The vicinity is the dwelling-place of desolation;
nothing but rocks about us. What had once
perhaps been a solid mass of trachyte is split to
fragments in the mill of the centuries, and bits
from as big as one's fist to the size of one's body
or a small house lay tumbled in a confused and
monstrous heap, as though there might have been
in the remote ages, a great temple here dedicated
to the gods of old, and now in shapeless ruins.</p>

<p>Of the view from this great mountain peak,
what shall I or any one say? Nothing! It does
not admit of description; upon it, you can understand
why the Indian never mounts so high. It
is one of the places whence comes his inspiration
of deity, the temple of his god, and he may not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
desecrate it with his unhallowed feet; it gathers
the storm, and the sun caresses it into a smile and
crowns it with glory, as he views it reverently
from the valley. But we, the civilized, penetrate
the mystery of these heights and find, what? humility!
and feel as though we should have worshipped
from afar. We have risen to receive the
divine inspiration, our brother has remained below
to kiss submissively the nether threshold of the
sanctuary. Which is nearest to the Father?</p>

<p>It is very still to-day; no sound greets you save
the gentlest murmur of the summer wind brushing
lightly across the uninviting rocks. The wide
plains checkered with green and gold, stretching
away out below you, give you no sign. The city
you see there, bustling with the ambition of youthful
vigor, is silent as death; you recognize it as a
town-plat on paper, that is all, except that it adds
to the sense of your own insignificance; it may
make you wonder, perhaps, why you were ever a
part of the life there; it may be a shadow that
you look down upon, as you would recall an almost
faded dream. You turn.</p>

<p class="pp2">
"And the mountain world stands present<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And behold a wond'rous corps&mdash;<br />
Well I knew them each, though never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had we met in life before&mdash;<br />
Knew them by that dream-world knowledge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All unknown to earthly lore."
</p>

<p>Just below you a vast ocean bed of billowy hills,
with its stately pines dwarfed to shrubs, its shores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
looming up in the dim distance through their
dainty veil of gray, and brooding over all that</p>

<p class="pp5">
"Awful voice of stillness,<br />
Which the Seer discerned in Horeb;<br />
That which hallowed Beth El's ground."
</p>

<p>It seems like sacrilege, but the interest in that
town-plat down there, or in one like it, begins
tugging at the skirts of one's adoration. The sun
is going down and we also must go.</p>

<p>I had an interview with the driver, out behind
the barn. (There is a signal station on the summit
and the barn is a necessity.)</p>

<p>"You are sure you can go to Cascade from here
in two hours and a half?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Certain."</p>

<p>"Take something?" and I made a feint of
reaching into the inside pocket of my coat for
"something" I did not have.</p>

<p>"Can't! that's agin' the rules&mdash;I'm a man of
family and I don't care to lose my job."</p>

<p>"So am I a man of family, and my friend, the
Major there, he has a family&mdash;a wife and nine children,
all young. You love your family?"</p>

<p>"What do you ask that for? 'Course I do."</p>

<p>"So does the Major love his&mdash;the eldest only ten
years old. You noticed, perhaps, on coming up,
when we were talking about making time, going
down 'in a whirl;' I think you expressed it so?
Yes, he said not a word, just sat and listened. He
was thinking about the seventeen miles down hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
round those short curves, in two hours and a half.
The Major has a slight heart trouble, and any little
excitement, like rolling down the mountain side,
or getting upset, might be injurious to him.
Being a man with a large family I desire to avoid
his running any risk&mdash;you understand? His
family is dependent on him and he has no life
insurance. Now, the making of this trip in two
hours and a half might be well enough for me,
because I am used to it, you know; I haven't so
much of a family, and I've ridden with Bill
Updyke and Jake Hawks, and there is nothing I
should like better than just such a ride as you
proposed&mdash;I'd glory in it, but I'm a little uneasy
about the Major. The doctor has already warned
him against any undue excitement. Hold on a
minute! there is another matter: he'd never hint
that he is nervous, he is very averse to having it
thought that he is troubled that way&mdash;see? And
just as like as not, to show you that he is not
nervous, he would tell you to 'Let 'em out!' Now&mdash;hold
on a minute! if he should tell you so, don't
you do it&mdash;you just go round those curves quietly,
and trot along easy like, or walk. He's a very
close friend of mine, you can understand. Take
this," and I slipped a half-dollar into the driver's
hand. Just then I heard the Major yelling to me
with the voice of a strong man in enviable health
to "hurry up."</p>

<p>The driver accepted the half-dollar and went
round one end of the barn to the carriage, while I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
took the other way. When we were seated he
touched the off leader gently, the team started,
and then he twirled the long lash of his whip with
a graceful and fancy curve that rounded up with
a report like that of a small pistol. The mules
struck into a gallop and I concluded that my half-dollar
was wasted, literally thrown away, to say
nothing of my other appeal. The loss of the
latter caused me the more chagrin&mdash;the money
was a trifle. But think of that blessed stage-driver
ignoring my eloquence! By the great horn spoon!
as Joshua would have expressed it, if I had a gun
and was not deterred by the thought of consequences,
I'd leave the wretch as food for the eagles&mdash;he'd
never be missed. Just about the time I
had him fairly killed and his body comfortably
rolled over a precipice where it would never be
discovered, he came to the first turn. The mules
were on a dead run, and what did that&mdash;blessed
driver do? He just let that silk out again, gave
a yell like a Comanche and whirled round that
bend without so much as allowing the wheels to
slide a quarter of an inch, and away he went,
down the short, straight stretch as though he had
been paid to go somewhere in a hurry. When he
made the next turn I leaned over and said quietly:
"Let me see that half-dollar I gave you; perhaps
it is plugged."</p>

<p>He changed his lines and whip into his left
hand and passed over the suspected coin with his
right. I substituted a silver dollar, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
slipped into his pocket, straightened out his lines
and brought the mules down to a trot.</p>

<p>"Why don't you let 'em out, driver?" inquired
the Major.</p>

<p>The driver looked round as if he thought I had
addressed him.</p>

<p>"I think you can let 'em go," I said, and he
did! Along the straight chutes! around the
bends! away and down, with a merry jingle of the
harness, the cool air turned into a breeze that
caressed our cheeks as lovingly as the kiss of a
child! Away and down, with the gleeful "hi!
he! g'lang there" of the driver, the mountains
began to tower above us! Away and down, with
the sharp reports of the curling lash, the cold
granite and dwarfed shrubs changed, and we sped
in among the stately pines! Away and down,
with hearts as light as the perfumed air, the flashes
of the sun stealing through the trees salutes our
flushed faces, and every moment a Te Deum Laudamus
whispers in ecstasy from our half-closed lips.
Eight miles and a half in thirty-five minutes!
Was there ever before such a ride vouchsafed to
mortal?</p>

<p>We sighed for four fresh mules to take us the
remainder of the way. The exhilaration was not
lost behind the horses, it was only toned down.
As the evening shades began to touch the valley
and while the sun yet kissed the mountains above
us, we brought up at the starting-place, happy.</p>

<p>A marvel of the book-maker's art is "<span class="smcap">Pine Valley</span>."&mdash;<i>Colorado
Sun.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Pine Valley</span>," by Lewis B. France, contains but two
stories, but these two are veritable cameos carved from
the boundless treasures of the Rockies.&mdash;<i>Denver Republican.</i></p>

<p>There is little that could be suggested in the way of
improvement in the dainty volume issued by the Chain
and Hardy Company of Denver, entitled "<span class="smcap">Pine Valley</span>,"
by Lewis B. France.&mdash;<i>Colorado Springs Gazette.</i></p>

<p>Its very simplicity is its highest charm. It is realistic
because incomplex. There is no stage effect. It is heart
to heart from the first sentence ... to the orphan
baby's lisping grace at that eventful Christmas feast
which made the desperado, Baltimore Hatch, a new
man.&mdash;<i>David H. Moore in Western Christian Advocate.</i></p>
